Since docker is running within boot2docker containers will be exposed via ports on the boot2docker IP.</p>\n<p>For example, if running <code>docker ps</code> tells you your app is exposing port 80 on some high-numbered port on the local host, it is actually exposed via boot2dockers IP:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID    IMAGE NAMES      PORTS\n6751b94bb5c0    ubuntu:latest    0.0.0.0:49154->80/tcp</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Going to <code>0.0.0.0:49154</code> in your browser won\'t work. You need to replace <code>0.0.0.0</code> with boot2docker\'s IP address. To find it, run:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>$ boot2docker ip\n\nThe VM\'s Host only interface IP address is: 192.168.55.555</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Putting that into the browser will along with the correct port will give you <code>192.168.55.555:49154</code> and you will be able to access your web app as expected.</p>\n<p>This may all be very simple for anyone familiar with networking, but it took me a good amount of time to figure this out with no error message. I guess you should just run Docker on Linux ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<p>Although not entirely related, I wrote a gist to automatically export boot2docker\'s IP address into an environment variable whenever it is set:</p>\n<p>{% gist iansinnott/0a0c212260386bdbfafb %}</p>',frontmatter:{created:"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z",title:"Using Docker on a Mac with Boot2Docker"}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/jandrix/dev/sites/blog.iansinnott.com/content/_posts/2014-09-25-using-docker-on-a-mac-with-boot2docker.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",next:{frontmatter:{title:"Programmer, Maker or Both?",created:"2014-09-24T07:00:00.000Z"},slug:"engineer-maker-or-both"},prev:{frontmatter:{title:"Road to Absterdam Part 1",created:"2014-09-26T07:00:00.000Z"},slug:"road-to-absterdam-part-1"}}}}});
