I grew up in tiny town called Point Arena, about four hours north of the Bay Area. Despite this, I never actually spent any significant time in San Francisco, so I was very excited to have the chance to live here for a month, especially after spending two years abroad. Better yet, the day I landed was my birthday :+1:</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>The Vibe is right...</h3>\n<p>As soon as I had spend 24 hours in the city, I could see myself living here. I like to walk and take public transportation, so I don't generally speak very highly of American cities. SF has that. Nightlife that's not strictly limited to weekends is also a plus, and that also seems to be a thing here. But what I have thus far enjoyed most about this city, is the mentality.</p>\n<p>People everywhere here are trying to start a company, or get recruited by their favorite company, or just build something cool in their spare time. Everyone seems to be <em>doing</em> something, and that something is usually very cool or at least interesting to hear about. I can see why many people say this place is a bubble, but it's not a bad bubble to find yourself in.</p>\n<h3>... but how does anyone get anything done?</h3>\n<p>This city is so good, and I've been having so much fun that I have gotten much less done than I did in Delhi, where I spent most of the day in an office.</p>\n<p>If I had to summarize my time here so far, I would simply say this city is too much fun to get much done. But that's OK, after I leave here I'm planning a trip to Washington before heading back to my favorite city: <strong>Taipei</strong> :)</p>",frontmatter:{created:"2014-07-08T07:00:00.000Z",title:"A Month In San Francisco"}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/jandrix/dev/sites/blog.iansinnott.com/content/_posts/2014-07-08-a-month-in-san-francisco.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",next:{frontmatter:{title:"Using Emoji in Excerpts on GitHub Pages",created:"2014-07-08T07:00:00.000Z"},slug:"using-emoji-in-excerpts-on-github-pages"},prev:{frontmatter:{title:"Using Dokku As A Personal Heroku",created:"2014-07-24T07:00:00.000Z"},slug:"using-dokku-as-a-personal-heroku"}}}}});
