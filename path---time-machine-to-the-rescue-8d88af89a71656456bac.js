It took about two hours to get most things reinstalled and running again, and after the fact I was very happy with the results. My computer is now fresh again, the downloads folder doesn\'t have 1000 items in it and I have over 100GB of free space (up from ~5GB before)! All in all a very quick and painless experience... until this week.</p>\n<h2 id="know-what-to-migrate"><a href="#know-what-to-migrate" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Know what to migrate</h2>\n<p>It\'s tough to keep track of everything on your system that\'s vital to your day-to-day workflow. The toughest are the things that aren\'t needed day-to-day, but which become vital the second you try do something that depends on them. In my case this was building an android app for distribution.</p>\n<p>To distribute an app on the Google Play Store you need to create a Java Keystore to sign your app with. This file is monumentally important if you\'re an app developer, because without it you cannot update your app. This week I had to update an app on Google Play and figured out how important that file was.</p>\n<h2 id="time-machine-to-the-rescue"><a href="#time-machine-to-the-rescue" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Time Machine to the rescue</h2>\n<p>Luckily, I did make sure to back up my entire system before reinstalling OSX, so I knew I must have my Java Keystore saved somewhere. I just had to find it. This was actually surprisingly fast as I had initially stored it under a folder named <code>keystore</code>. Simple enough. I hit restore in Time Machine and done, it was on my system.</p>\n<p>Excellent, now I just need to sign my Android APK and I would be good to go. This particular project is built with Cordova, so the easiest way I\'ve found to do this is to specify an <code>ant.properties</code> file under <code>platforms/android</code>. There\'s a great, concise <a href="http://ilee.co.uk/Sign-Releases-with-Cordova-Android/">article on this with full instructions</a>.</p>\n<p>Great, now to just run the command...</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>$ cordova build android --release\n\n...\n\n-release-prompt-for-password:\n    [input] Please enter keystore password</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>... shit. Did not remember my keystore required a password.</p>\n<p>At point I ended up trying a few common passwords all of which failed, but I did ultimately figure it out. I wrote a quick Ruby script to run through a list of about 20 potential passwords and one of them did turn out to be the right one. So in the end not a terrible experience, just a strong reminder that backing up everything is always a good idea, and backing up the keys to your apps is paramount.</p>',frontmatter:{created:"2014-10-03T07:00:00.000Z",title:"Time Machine to the Rescue"}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/jandrix/dev/sites/blog.iansinnott.com/content/_posts/2014-10-03-time-machine-to-the-rescue.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",next:{frontmatter:{title:"Running a Meteor App on Dokku",created:"2014-11-22T08:00:00.000Z"},slug:"running-a-meteor-app-on-dokku"},prev:{frontmatter:{title:"Business",created:"2014-10-01T07:00:00.000Z"},slug:"business"}}}}});
