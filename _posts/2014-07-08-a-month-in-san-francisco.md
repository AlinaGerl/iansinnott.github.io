## Four Weeks in _the_ city for tech

I'm from California. I grew up in tiny town called Point Arena, about four hours north of the Bay Area. Despite this, I never actually spent any significant time in San Francisco, so I was very excited to have the chance to live here for a month, especially after spending two years abroad. Better yet, the day I landed was my birthday :+1:

### The Vibe is right...

As soon as I had spend 24 hours in the city, I could see myself living here. I like to walk and take public transportation, so I don't generally speak very highly of American cities. SF has that. Nightlife that's not strictly limited to weekends is also a plus, and that also seems to be a thing here. But what I have thus far enjoyed most about this city, is the mentality.

People everywhere here are trying to start a company, or get recruited by their favorite company, or just build something cool in their spare time. Everyone seems to be _doing_ something, and that something is usually very cool or at least interesting to hear about. I can see why many people say this place is a bubble, but it's not a bad bubble to find yourself in.

### ... but how does anyone get anything done?

This city is so good, and I've been having so much fun that I have gotten much less done than I did in Delhi, where I spent most of the day in an office.

If I had to summarize my time here so far, I would simply say this city is too much fun to get much done. But that's OK, after I leave here I'm planning a trip to Washington before heading back to my favorite city: **Taipei** :)
