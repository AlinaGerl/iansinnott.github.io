## I Should Write More

I don&#8217;t necessarily want to, but I should. A [very nice article][1] I read today by [Nathan Marz][2] basically hammered home an idea I already knew to be true: Writing often and eventually writing well can be a key to success.

So, with that in mind I&#8217;m going to start writing more often. Not because I think the world needs to hear what I have to say (yet), and not because I think anyone actually reads my posts, but because it will help me improve.

## Upgrade

This new motivation to write isn&#8217;t just due to that article though. Over the past two months I&#8217;ve also made several other upgrades to my life style that will make this much easier.

### New Computer

That&#8217;s right, brand new Macbook Pro. The ultra sexy retina display means I can finally switch over to using Traditional Chinese as my default language and be able to see all the tiny strokes of characters I need to look up. The massive speed increase means I no longer loath opening Photoshop or more than one browser at a time. Point being, *This is awesome!*.

### New Phone

About two years ago I lost my then beloved iPhone 4. Now, after finally deciding to shell out the cash for an unlocked iPhone I&#8217;m once again a part of modern smartphone ubiquity. Feels good.

The point though, is not so much the phone as the great apps I now have access to, namely [Lift][3]. This boss of an app is simple, well-designed and made me wakeup without snooze this morning! Only slightly short of a miracle. The app is meant to help anyone acheive any goal simply through tracking. In the future I can see this taking a turn towards notifying all of Facebook/Twitter whenever you fail to meet a daily goal, but for now it is simply an accountability system with other lift users. Even so I can respect the influence this app has already had on me. Just having something to check off the moment I wake up is satisfying enough that I think I&#8217;ll keep doing it. Here&#8217;s hoping that&#8217;s the case.

The other big one is [Skritter][4]. I&#8217;ve been using this Chinese review software for months now but it never really had much of an impact on my studies until I got the new phone. Lately I&#8217;ve been using it any moment I don&#8217;t have anything better to do. This means on the subway or in the elevator usually. I obliterated my 1300 word study list that had accumulated from lack of use in a week.Cheers to productivity.
