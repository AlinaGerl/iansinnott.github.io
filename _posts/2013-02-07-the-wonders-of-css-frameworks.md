Today was my first dive into CSS frameworks. Creating layout from scratch is perfectly doable but also perfectly tedious. I have yet to meet a developer who enjoys that aspect of it. We like the stages where we get to build shiny things on a site. So here is what I got into today:

<a title="grid system" href="http://cssgrid.net/" target="_blank">The 1140 Grid System</p> <p>
  </a><a title="kube" href="http://imperavi.com/kube/" target="_blank">Kube</p> <p>
    </a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first one has been around for quite some time. The original developer actually stopped updating it because after creating it he learned so much that it lost it&#8217;s use. That&#8217;s awesome, but for a ton of developers it&#8217;s still a great tool. I would say it&#8217;s best feature is simplicity. It&#8217;s not the most robust framework but if you want something really light and simple to set up try it out.

    The second, Kube, is another fully responsive grid system. I didn&#8217;t really look into Kube&#8217;s layout features because I was already using 1140, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s good. I really like Kube&#8217;s design elements that make it super simple to add very sophisticated styling to elements in a few seconds. The one drawback to me was that it is built with LESS instead of Sass. I actually run into this fairly often. It seems as though the majority of the well known frameworks are built with LESS.

    So, instead of sit around and pout I converted a number of Kube&#8217;s features into Sass. Now I&#8217;m developing with a mix of these two grid systems. Kube mainly for UI elements and 1140 for layout. I&#8217;m considering actually rolling these together into something usable and Sass based (finally) so that anyone else can enjoy it without switching to LESS. I&#8217;ll post an update with that is finished.
