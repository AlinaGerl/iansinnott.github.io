I also like to use the excellent <a href="http://marked2app.com/">Marked</a> app to preview my markdown. Unfortunately, even though Marked claims to support <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/">Github Flavored Markdown</a> (GFM) it leaves some features out. I\'m not going to blame Marked for the incomplete implementation of GFM, they outsource the processing to <a href="https://github.com/Orc/discount">Discount</a>, so it\'s probably not their fault. But certain features of GFM, like nested lists, are really useful so I decided to switch to <a href="https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet">RedCarpet</a>, since that is the Gem GitHub itself uses to parse READMEs.</p>\n<p>So, for anyone else who runs into the issue of Marked\'s incomplete GFM support, simply install <code>redcarpet</code> and use it as a custom processor:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>sudo gem install redcarpet</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>In the "Advanced" section of Marked\'s preferences you can find the custom processor section:</p>\n<p><img src="https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen_Shot_2015-01-26_at_2_26_54_PM.jpg" alt="Custom Marked Processor"></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You <em>might</em> have to click the "Update Permissions" button since Marked may not have read access to wherever you\'re <code>redcarpet</code> executable is located.</p>\n<p>Once you\'ve added the custom processor you should get a little nondescript button near the lower right-hand side of your Marked windows:</p>\n<p><img src="https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen_Shot_2015-01-26_at_2_27_38_PM.jpg" alt="Custom processor button in Marked"></p>\n<p>If you click that button you should now get markdown rendered through your custom processor! Nice ðŸ˜Ž</p>\n<p>Hope that helps anyone who ran into the same problem I did.</p>',frontmatter:{created:"2015-01-26T08:00:00.000Z",title:"Use RedCarpet to Render Markdown",disqusId:null}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/jandrix/dev/sites/blog.iansinnott.com/content/_posts/2015-01-26-use-redcarpet-to-render-markdown.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",next:{frontmatter:{title:"Express Basics",created:"2015-02-02T08:00:00.000Z"},slug:"express-basics"},prev:{frontmatter:{title:"Back to the JavaScript Basics",created:"2015-01-09T08:00:00.000Z"},slug:"back-to-the-javascript-basics"}}}}});
