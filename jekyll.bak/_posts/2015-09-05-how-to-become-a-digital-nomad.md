For about 2 years between 2012-2014 I lived abroad, making money on the side while I did pretty much whatever I felt like at the time. I've never written in depth about how I went from no income and no technical skills to full financial independence while working remotely. Here's what I did, and what I often recommend to anyone who asks about living and working abroad.

## Step One: Go abroad

This is this easy part. Just book a plane ticket and go. It may seem counter intuitive to do this _before_ finding a way to make money but it's really fine, and more importantly actually being abroad makes everything real and provides strong incentive to find a source of income.

If working abroad is your goal, booking a plane ticket is a very concrete step in the right direction. Once you have a ticket things will be set in motion. It's much harder to put of your travel plans once you have a ticket. 

## Step Two: Enjoy Yourself

This step is extremely important, as it's the whole reason anyone decides to work remotely in the first place (right?). In my case I took three months after moving to Taiwan to just enjoy myself. Three months might be more time or less time than you want, but it's important to take some time. As long as you have just a bit of savings you should be able to relax for a few months and settle in to your new surroundings.

## Step Three: Find a source of income

So, after a few months of just enjoying yourself it's probably time to start putting money back into your bank account. First off, the fallback option:

### The fallback plan

Teach English. If you're reading this you probably speak English well enough to teach it, and this is a great way to make some side income while you figure out a more permanent means of generating income. Also, there's nothing wrong with just teaching English for a while. It will afford you a pretty healthy lifestyle depending on what country your in, and maybe you'll even enjoy it. I didn't, but that's just me.

The downside of teaching English is that it ties you to a location just like most jobs, which is assumedly what you left your country to escape. Bit again, this is a great temporary option and can even become a permanent one if you decide you love the country your living in that much.

### Plan A

There are a plethora of ways to make money from your computer while abroad. Here are a few things you can do from anywhere that people will pay you for:

* Software development
* Graphic design
* Copywriting
* Online marketing / website optimization
* Translation
* Accounting

That's by _*no means*_ an exhaustive list, but its purpose is to demonstrate that there are many _different_ skills that can be applicable to working remotely. You do not have to know design or development, the mainstays of nomadic freelancers.

More importantly, you _don't_ need to have **any** applicable skills. You can just learn a new one. This is exactly what I did. I learned software development and started building web apps for clients to support myself. 

I'm not saying that to toot my own horn, but to demonstrate that you don't need any existing skills to freely with full financial independence.

For me personally, learning to write some code was the path of least resistance to sustainable remote income, so the rest of this posts will focus on how I learned to code and started making income.

In brief, this is the roadmap I followed to start earning income remotely:

1. Learn to code
2. Create a portfolio website for yourself
3. Get clients (hustle)

Now that we have the basic roadmap, let's dive into the specifics a bit more.

## 1. Learning to code

There's no single way to learn code. This is party of why it's so hard for beginners, since it's not clear where to start. Here is how I did it:

1. Learn HTML and CSS
2. Build a basic website
3. Build a few websites FOR FREE for fiends/family/anyone (this will go in your portfolio as "past clients")
4. Build a portfolio website for yourself
5. Learn PHP and WordPress
6. Rebuild your portfolio site as a WordPress site
7. Deploy it to your domain

It's important to note that in this list you're learning, building and also deploying. Any client expects you to be able to not only build their site but put it online for the world to see, so don't overlook step #7.

As for the actual learning, there are myriad online resources for learning web development. I'll include links to some of my favorites that I actually used at the bottom under resources.

## 2. The portfolio

This step is very easy once you've learned the basics of coding. Since at this point you've made a couple sites for friends and family you have something to show as "past works". This helps assuage clients' fear that you don't know what you're doing. Even if you don't know what you're doing, that's fine. The best way to learn is to do.

One note about the portfolio site: It should look decent. If you're not a designer that's fine, buy a pre-made template and built your site to look just like it.

This is an extremely helpful exercise in what being a developer really is. Generally clients send you an image or PSD file and expect you to turn it into a website. So go here and buy a template:

http://themeforest.net/category/psd-templates

ThemeForest also sells pre-made WordPress templates. It's important that you DON'T buy one of those just yet, because you want to build it yourself to solidify your skills as a web developer.

## 3. Get Clients (aka the fun part)

Now the fun starts. You get to go out in the world and convince people to give you money. Learning how to market yourself is absolutely, positively and unquestionably a universal skill that will serve you well no matter what you end up doing in life. That's why this is the fun part.

Finding clients will teach you so many useful skills that it's a wonder marketing yourself isn't part of the core curriculum in college. 

So here's how you can start finding clients as a web developer:

1. Update your public profiles (LinkedIn, FB, website, etc) to reflect your new profession 
2. Announce this new career move on FB / Twitter / LinkedIn (this is exactly how I found my first paying client)
3. Apply for jobs online
4. Network with people you meet in real life and be very open about what you do for a living

#3 is a point many people struggle with when the first start out because they don't know where to apply. The general rule is this:

**Go niche.**

Web development is not a niche. Your niche at the beginning will be WordPress development. You create beautiful WordPress websites for clients around the world. Let that message resonate throughout all your online profiles, then go to the job boards listed under resources bellow and start applying. Writing proposals and sending cold emails to potential clients are ancillary skills that you will develop as you go. You can also ask me for advice on that subject as well, but don't worry about that until you are ready to apply to 20 jobs a day.

## 4. Profit

That's it. Marketing yourself will be an ongoing endeavor, but once you start getting paid you will likely find it bearable, if not quite enjoyable. After cash starts rolling in the last thing to do is to hit the local ATM and then go out on the town.

## Resources

#### Learning to code

There are a bunch of resources out there but here are some of my favorites:

* http://www.codecademy.com/ (totally free)
* http://freecodecamp.com/ (totally free. build real products for free and gain skills)
* https://www.codeschool.com/ (paid)
* http://www.lynda.com/ (paid, but they might have a trial)
* https://learn.wordpress.com/ (if you're doing wordpress)

Between the first two you can very easily learn HTML, CSS, PHP and WordPress. That's exactly how I did it. I would start with CodeCademy since their tutorials are very interactive and also shorter than Lynda's. Then move on to Lynda for more in depth training on all the topics listed above.

That last link is for learning WordPress as a web app, not learning how to program it. However it's still very important you can use WordPress as a client would. It's also inevitable that clients will ask questions about how to use some feature of the site, and it's part of your job to know the answer.

#### Other

Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com/). Read this site from time to time. You will often find interesting articles about freelancing and running your own business. That's how I first found out about NomadList.

NomadList (https://nomadlist.com/). I'll let you explore this on your own. It's creator is one of the "leading" digital nomads if you believe in such a thing. I will say that there info on Taipei isn't all that accurate, but it's still a good source of nomad-specific information.

NomadList also has a Slack chatroom with various channels for different cities around the world. It's quite active in many cities, so it would be something to check out as a means of meeting like-minded people while you travel.
