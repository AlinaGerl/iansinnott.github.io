Today I met the goal I set a month ago of making money as a freelancer. Well, that was a two week goal so I didn't exactly meet it. But the work I did during those weeks working towards this goal was the foundation for success, and now the benefits of my work have become tangible. This is just the beginning though. One goal should lead to another, so tomorrow I will figure out what that next goal shall be.
