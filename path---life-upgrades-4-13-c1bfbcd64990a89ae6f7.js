A <a href="http://nathanmarz.com/blog/you-should-blog-even-if-you-have-no-readers.html">very nice article</a> I read today by <a href="http://nathanmarz.com/" title="Nathan">Nathan Marz</a> basically hammered home an idea I already knew to be true: Writing often and eventually writing well can be a key to success.</p>\n<p>So, with that in mind I\'m going to start writing more often. Not because I think the world needs to hear what I have to say (yet), and not because I think anyone actually reads my posts, but because it will help me improve.</p>\n<h2 id="upgrade"><a href="#upgrade" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Upgrade</h2>\n<p>This new motivation to write isn\'t just due to that article though.

Now, after finally deciding to shell out the cash for an unlocked iPhone I\'m once again a part of modern smartphone ubiquity. Feels good.</p>\n<p>The point though, is not so much the phone as the great apps I now have access to, namely <a href="http://lift.do/" title="Lift App">Lift</a>. This boss of an app is simple, well-designed and made me wakeup without snooze this morning! Only slightly short of a miracle. The app is meant to help anyone achieve any goal simply through tracking. In the future I can see this taking a turn towards notifying all of Facebook/Twitter whenever you fail to meet a daily goal, but for now it is simply an accountability system with other lift users. Even so I can respect the influence this app has already had on me. Just having something to check off the moment I wake up is satisfying enough that I think I\'ll keep doing it. Here\'s hoping that\'s the case.</p>\n<p>The other big one is <a href="http://skritter.com/" title="Skritter App">Skritter</a>. I\'ve been using this Chinese review software for months now but it never really had much of an impact on my studies until I got the new phone. Lately I\'ve been using it any moment I don\'t have anything better to do. This means on the subway or in the elevator usually. I obliterated my 1300 word study list that had accumulated from lack of use in a week.Cheers to productivity.</p>',frontmatter:{created:"2013-04-30T07:00:00.000Z",title:"Life Upgrades & Reasons To Write More"}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/jandrix/dev/sites/blog.iansinnott.com/content/_posts/2013-04-30-life-upgrades-4-13.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",next:{frontmatter:{title:"Victory!
