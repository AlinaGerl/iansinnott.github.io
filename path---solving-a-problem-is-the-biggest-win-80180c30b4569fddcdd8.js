It\'s not uncommon during an initial phone screen to be asked some variation of the following ‚Äúsoft‚Äù interview question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What are you passionate about?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>or...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why do you like software development?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As simple and possibly over-used as these questions are, they\'re still good ones. So am I <em>really</em> passionate about software development? Hell yes. But that\'s not the answer to the underlying question of why‚Äîwhy am I passionate about it?</p>\n<p>It\'s this line of thinking that has led me to do some introspection recently, and I\'ve come to the conclusion that what it really boils down to is <strong>solving problems</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id="solving-problems-is-the-biggest-win"><a href="#solving-problems-is-the-biggest-win" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Solving problems is the biggest win</h2>\n<p>When you solve a problem for yourself it feels great. Not only that, but you then have one less problem. The satisfaction of solving problems certainly isn\'t exclusive to programming, but programming is one of the best tools to solve an extremely wide array of problems, which is why I love it.</p>\n<p>But as satisfying as solving one\'s own problems can be, the biggest win in my mind is to ...</p>\n<h2 id="solve-other-peoples-problems"><a href="#solve-other-peoples-problems" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Solve other people\'s problems</h2>\n<p>This realization really solidified in my mind a number of months ago as I was combing through <a href="https://github.com/iansinnott">my GitHub profile</a> to clean out old repositories I no longer use.

It\'s that motivation that has kept that little project going. That motivation is really powerful.</p>\n<p>In this way solving someone\'s problem can become a positive feedback loop: The more positive feedback you get about your project and the way it\'s solving problems, the more you\'re motivated to continue to solve that problem.</p>\n<p>It\'s a beautiful thing.</p>',frontmatter:{created:"2015-02-20T08:00:00.000Z",title:"Solving problems is the biggest win",disqusId:null}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/jandrix/dev/sites/blog.iansinnott.com/content/_posts/2015-02-20-solving-a-problem-is-the-biggest-win.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",next:{frontmatter:{title:"In search of the ultimate tooling workflow",created:"2015-05-03T07:00:00.000Z"},slug:"in-search-of-the-ultimate-tooling-workflow"},prev:{frontmatter:{title:"A New Direction",created:"2015-02-16T08:00:00.000Z"},slug:"a-new-direction"}}}}});
