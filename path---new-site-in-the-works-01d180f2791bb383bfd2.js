Under "Work", the old site lists a number of personal projects that donâ€™t even exist anymore. The "Skills" section is likewise outdated, listing PHP, MySQL and Photoshop. These days those have all been replaced by Node.js/Ruby, MongoDB and Sketch respectively.</p>\n<p>If I\'m being honest with myself I don\'t think the old site is <em>that</em> bad, but it\'s time for a change. I\'ll be launching sometime before Christmas. ðŸ˜Ž</p>',frontmatter:{created:"2014-12-13T08:00:00.000Z",title:"New Site in the Works",disqusId:null}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/ian/dev/sites/blog.iansinnott.com/content/_posts/2014-12-13-new-site-in-the-works.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",next:{frontmatter:{title:"New Site Is Live",created:"2015-01-08T08:00:00.000Z"},slug:"new-site-is-live"},prev:{frontmatter:{title:"A Site a Day",created:"2014-12-08T08:00:00.000Z"},slug:"a-site-a-day"}}}}});
