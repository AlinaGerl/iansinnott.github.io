It\'s a blog, so I knew I wouldn\'t need too much JS. I started with a blank file and started coding.</p>\n<p>Once I was satisfied with the event handling logic I had set up I sat back and reviewed my work. 44 lines including a few comments and zero dependencies. Not too bad. The web has come a long way. CSS was able to take care of a lot of the interactions and animations. But I still wanted to do better.</p>\n<p>It occurred to me that I could actually use the <code>:hover</code> state to accomplish all of my open/close menu interactions. Done! A few more lines eliminated. But I still had the <code>focus</code> event handler I was using to select all text in a text box whenever a user put their cursor inside it. I don\'t think CSS can do that... so I did end up using JS for this. I took it out of my script file and in-lined it on the input directly.</p>\n<p>That was the last event I was handling so now I scrapped my whole JS file with its event logic. Wow! No external JS file. How novel... ðŸ˜•.</p>\n<p>All in all here is the extent of the JS I wrote for the site:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code><span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">setSelectionRange</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>value<span class="token punctuation">.</span>length<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Aside:</strong> I\'m certainly not against large web appsâ€”on the contrary, I love them. But for this particular project I chose to revel in the minimalism of leveraging CSS to handle almost all of my site interactions.</p>',frontmatter:{created:"2016-11-16T08:00:00.000Z",title:"A refreshing dose of minimalism",disqusId:null}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/ian/dev/sites/blog.iansinnott.com/content/_posts/2016-11-16-a-refreshing-dose-of-minimalism.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",next:{frontmatter:{title:"The importance of Webpack context",created:"2016-11-24T08:00:00.000Z"},slug:"the-importance-of-webpack-context"},prev:{frontmatter:{title:"Migrating from Jekyll to Hexo",created:"2016-11-16T08:00:00.000Z"},slug:"migrating-from-jekyll-to-hexo"}}}}});
