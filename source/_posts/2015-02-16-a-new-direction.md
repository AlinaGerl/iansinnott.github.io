title: A New Direction
---

For the past few years I've been living in Taiwan running my own freelance business. It's been an amazing, transformative experience and I've had a great time doing it. Entering 2015, I was planning to continue growing my business into the foreseeable future, but after a recent revelation I feel it's time for a change.

**It's time to get a _real_ job.**

At my last “job” I was my own boss, I worked my own hours, I traveled often and lived however I wanted. So, why then would I choose to give all that up? The answer is simple, it's because...

**I'm in my comfort zone.**

I woke up one morning and realized: **I've acclimated.** I'm no longer challenged on a daily basis. This was a hard realization to come by, but it's true. The projects I had been working on might have been fun or interesting but they were ultimately well within my current skill set, which means I had stopped pushing.

**“Never stop pushing.”**

I once heard that quote somewhere and it really resonated with me. I never want to stop improving or stop iterating on my own talents. So I've decided to join a startup and find something I'm truly passionate about working on. I want to learn and grow at the same time as I provide value to a company I admire.

There are a number of companies I'm already very passionate about and likely many others I haven't heard of yet, so...

**The search is on.**

For the next few months I'll be staying in San Francisco learning, improving, meeting new people and looking for the right company. I don't expect it to be easy, but it will be worthwhile.
