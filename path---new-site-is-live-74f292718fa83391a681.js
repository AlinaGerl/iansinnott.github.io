The previous iterations of my site were all influenced heavily by designer friends of mine, but this latest work is my own. So you'll have to excuse me if I'm a little more excited than usual about launching a new site.</p>\n<h2>Note quite done</h2>\n<p>All that being said, there is still work to be done. The new site isn't entirely consistent with this blog. It's not a very big deal, but I really like consistency so updating this site to match the new visual style is now on my to-do list. The new site is also thoroughly untested, so if you stumble upon a part of it that seems broken please don't hesitate to <a href=\"http://iansinnott.com/contact\">get in touch</a> and let me know.</p>",frontmatter:{created:"2015-01-08T08:00:00.000Z",title:"New Site Is Live"}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/jandrix/dev/sites/blog.iansinnott.com/content/_posts/2015-01-08-new-site-is-live.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",next:{frontmatter:{title:"New Site in the Works",created:"2014-12-13T08:00:00.000Z"},slug:"new-site-in-the-works"},prev:{frontmatter:{title:"Back to the JavaScript Basics",created:"2015-01-09T08:00:00.000Z"},slug:"back-to-the-javascript-basics"}}}}});
