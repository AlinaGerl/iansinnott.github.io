When I look back on those initial stages of learning I think about how much quicker the process could have been if I had just dove in and conquered obstacles as they arose.\n\nFor beginner WP developers it may be tempting to stick with theme modification. By this I mean just taking a theme, whether premium or free, and simply modifying bits of it's code (or child theming) to get the desired results. This can be great in some cases and well warranted. However, in the end this leaves you or your client with a pile of code you may or may not fully understand (seriously, open up `functions.php` on a theme you didn't create and witness how much excess code your theme ships with).\n\nI was in the same boat initially, child-theming and theme-editing my way to early victories. This was important, but it wasn't until after I built my first theme from scratch that I felt fully in control of my theme. Building a theme from scratch also gives you a nice sense of accomplishment in the end that you may not get from editing an existing theme: everything you see in the final design was your own doing. So what is starting from scratch? An empty folder in `wp-content/themes/` on your local dev server.

Creating layout from scratch is perfectly doable but also perfectly tedious. I have yet to meet a developer who enjoys that aspect of it.

The original developer actually stopped updating it because after creating it he learned so much that it lost it's use. That's awesome, but for a ton of developers it's still a great tool. I would say it's best feature is simplicity. It's not the most robust framework but if you want something really light and simple to set up try it out.\n\nThe second, Kube, is another fully responsive grid system. I didn't really look into Kube's layout features because I was already using 1140, but I'm sure it's good. I really like Kube's design elements that make it super simple to add very sophisticated styling to elements in a few seconds. The one drawback to me was that it is built with LESS instead of Sass. I actually run into this fairly often. It seems as though the majority of the well known frameworks are built with LESS.\n\nSo, instead of sit around and pout I converted a number of Kube's features into Sass. Now I'm developing with a mix of these two grid systems. Kube mainly for UI elements and 1140 for layout.

Well if you use a Mac your in the right place, but guess what we need before we get started? A local development environment! If you don't know what that is, read the next paragraph. If you do, then skip down. Even if you already have a local dev server set up this will still be useful knowledge should you want to untether yourself from MAMP or any other AMP stack bundle.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n**Windows Users:** This article is about setting up a local dev environment on Mac OSX 10.8. You will also need to get an AMP stack up and running but I'm not familiar with Windows so I'm just going to recommend [WAMP](http://bitnami.org/stack/wamp) (sigh).\n\n## The Local Dev Environment\n\nWhen you code in PHP you need somewhere to test your work as you go along. This is where the local dev server comes in. You will also need a local dev server if you do any sort of online development. What the local dev server is&#8230; is just that: a server that runs on your computer. When you buy web hosting your paying for disk space on someone else's server. That server is running server-side software that let's you do many things, like using PHP and MySQL. So we're going to set up the same thing running from our own computer. This means web files (.php, .html, etc.) on your own hard drive will be hosted and served to your browser. **Let's go!**\n\n### This tutorial\n\nThere are so many tutorials on this subject out there, so why read this one&#8230; I'll tell you: Because most of the rest suck. Notice how I said most. I will refer in this lesson to some tutorials elsewhere that are actually very useful. Also, I will be focusing on setting up a professional dev environment, free of MAMP or XAMP or whatever else is out there. If you've ever seen/used MAMP Pro this is essentially setting up the same thing without a GUI. And my way is free!\n\nThere is also the added benefit that you get to better understand your server, learn a bit of terminal and in the end feel a huge sense of accomplishment (maybe). So with that, let's see what we will need to get started.\n\n### Necessary Ingredients\nTodays recipe is fairly simple in prep, more difficult later on in pickup. Her's what we need (follow the links to download):\n\n1. phpMyAdmin (maybe not 'required' but you want it)\n2. MySQL\n3. An open Terminal window (../Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)\n\n**Disclaimer:** This tutorial is for Mac OSX 10.8. I've seen it work on 10.6 and 10.7 but you may run into bugs that I don't solve in this post.\n\nNow let's get cooking! The first step is in Terminal. Before we really delve in we want to make a backup copy of the files we're going to edit. Skip this step if you like, but do so at your own peril. I don't want to see angry comments later saying I broke your machine.\n\n### Step 0: Setup / Backup\n\nIf it doesn't already exit, make a file under your home directory called `Sites`. This is going to be the root of your server, and where you will store all your sites. In this new folder make another folder called something like 'server-backup'. This is where we will backup to.\n\nThe three files we will be editing are:\n\n1. `httpd.conf`\n2. `httpd-vhosts.conf`\n3. `[username].conf`\n\nThat last one is specific to you. During this post if I write '[username]' what I mean is your own username on the system. You can find this if you don't know it by typing `whoami` into terminal and hitting return.\n\nSo to backup these files do the following commands.\n\n\n1. `cp /etc/apache2/httpd.conf ~/Sites/server-backup`\n2. `cp /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf ~/Sites/server-backup`\n3. `cp /etc/apache2/users/[username].conf ~/Sites/server-backup`\n\nThat last command may or may not work because you may not have created the [username].conf file yet. Don't worry, we'll get to that soon.\n\n**One last setup step:** You will need to be able to open files for editing _from the Terminal_. You can use whatever editor you want. My favorite is [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2). I wrote a quick [writeup on SB2](http://iansinnott.com) that you can check out if your interested. To see how to set up sublime for terminal use, check out this [Gist on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/artero/1236170). If you don't want to do anything like that and just want to get moving, use nano. It's built in to Terminal. Use it by typing something like the following:\n\n```\nnano [filename]\n```\n\nWhere '[filename]' would be the file you want to open and edit. It's a bit esoteric so I don't recommend it, but it's built into your computer.\n\n### Step 1: Enabling Apache\n\nOpen up Terminal. Then use the following command to start Apache:\n\n```\nsudo apachectl start\n```\n\nNow fire up your favorite browser and make sure everything is in order. In the nav bar type <a href=\"http://localhost\">http://localhost</a>. You should see something like this displaying the text &#8220;It Works!&#8221;:\n\n<img src=\"http://coolestguyplanettech.com/downtown/sites/default/files/itworks.png\" alt=\"it works apache\" />\n\nNow that we're all set there, let's see what we're looking at. Localhost is the default web root for your local server. The file being displayed can be found here:\n\n```\n/Library/WebServer/Documents/\n```\n\nThis is the system root, but we want to get your user root directory running properly. That's the next step.\n\n### The User Root\n\nRemember the 'Sites' folder you created? Open finder and get to it. If you haven't made that file yet for some reason, create it now and name it 'Sites'. Here's a pic I pulled from Google. You can see the Sites folder at the bottom.\n\n#### Set Up Development Folders\n\nNow within the Sites folder you need to create all the folders you want to be able to serve to your local browser. You can make as many as you want. For instance, my sites folder contains wp1.dev, wp2.dev, etc. I also have a folder named ian.dev where I keep the local installation of my personal site for editing. Name these folders whatever you want. The point is that each one will eventually contain a full site. Just name the folder something that you don't mind typing into a browser (i.e. something short).\n\n<a href=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/home-folder.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/home-folder.jpeg?w=300\" alt=\"Making the sites folder\" /></a>\n\nThis is the home folder for the user 'admin'.\n\nNow it's time to get serious. We need to edit your computers hosts file so that when we actually type these addresses into the browser they are redirected. To edit the hosts file do this:\n\n```\nsudo subl /private/etc/hosts\n```\n\nOr, if you are using nano do this:\n\n```\nsudo nano /private/etc/hosts\n```\n<p>It doesn't matter what is currently in there, but don't delete anything. What were going to do is add some lines to the bottom. You need to add '127.0.0.1&#8242; followed by the name of one of the folders you just created. So for my wp1.dev site I have a line in my hosts file that reads '127.0.0.1 wp1.dev'. Here's a bit of my hosts file:</p>\n```\n127.0.0.1 ian.dev\n127.0.0.1 wp1.dev\n127.0.0.1 wp2.dev\n127.0.0.1 wp3.dev\n```\n\n<p>You see that I have my personal site plus three development servers. This list actually goes all the way to wp15.dev, but you get the point. I recommend creating more of these aliases than you think you will need so you don't have to come back and edit hosts later. As I'll show you in a bit, this allows me to simply create a new folder in Sites with one of these names and bam! a new site is good to go. Now save hosts and exit Sublime or whatever text editor your in.</p>\n<p>Jump into Terminal and do the following two commands:</p>\n\n```\ncd /etc/apache2/users\nsudo nano username.conf\n```\n\nYou will need to enter your password to use sudo commands. For anyone not familiar with the Terminal, the first line gets us to the right folder and the second line opens up the file for editing. Past in the following, but remember to put your username in the place of 'your_user_name'. For me it's /Users/Ian/Sites/:\n\n```\n<Directory \"/Users/ian/Sites/\">\nOptions Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks\nAllowOverride All AuthConfig\nOrder allow,deny\nAllow from all\n</Directory>\n```\n\nNow save the changes and close out of nano. Your editing window will show you the hotkeys you need at the bottom. It will probably prompt you to name your file when you save. Keep the name unchanged so that we overwrite the original.\n\nNow check the permissions on the file you just edited. To do that type `ls -lah` in Terminal. As long as you're in the right directory already, it should look something like this:\n\n```\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  148 12 28 21:11 username.conf\n```\nIf the permissions come up with anything other than `-rw-r--r--` use this next command to fix them:\n\n```\nsudo chmod 644 username.conf\n```\n\nRemember you can't just copy and paste that. You need to write in your own username. Now restart Apache. You will need to use this command several more times so keep it on hand.\n\n```\nsudo apachectl restart\n\n```\n\n## Setting Up PHP (editing httpd.conf)\n\nFinally! We're going to get PHP running. This is actually super simple. All we have to do is uncomment a line in our Apache config file. Before we do that I will say again: **BE CAREFUL!** This file is one of those system files that can seriously break things if not handled with care. If you have been following from the beginning you already backed this file up, so your all set. Alright, back to it. Do this:\n\n```\nsudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\n```\n\n<p>Now find and uncomment the following line:</p>\n\n```\nLoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so\n\n```\n\nWhen within nano, you can use the 'control + W' hotkey to search the document. After you remove the '#' and save the file that's it, PHP is enabled. However, I'm going to suggest you don't close out of httpd.conf just yet. Let's make a few more changes while were here.\n\nMove down a number of lines to roughly 130. You should see two lines of code for User and Group. Comment the existing lines and input your own username and the group name staff. It should look like this:\n\n```\n#User _www\n#Group _www\nUser username\nGroup staff\n\n```\n\nThis makes Apache run as you, meaning you will be given full server permissions. This is optional but it may save you trouble later. For me it was needed to allow local WordPress installations to download and install plugins/themes from the back end. I'll also remind you again to make user you replace 'username' with your own user name. If you're having an identity crisis, use the `whoami` command.\n\nNow find the following line of code via search (ctrl+w in nano):\n\n```\n#Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n\n```\n\nRemove the pound sign to uncomment. This enables the virtual hosts file which is necessary to turn our folders within Sites into local websites.\n\nFinally, search for the text “AllowOverride”. This will bring you to a comment block describing “what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.” This is what you’re after. Change the line `AllowOverride None` to `AllowOverride All`. Save and close your httpd.conf file, hopefully you will never have to touch it again.\n\n**The User.conf File**\n\nNext we need to edit a user specific file. In terminal do the following, replacing username with your user name:\n\n```\nsudo nano /private/etc/apache2/users/Ian.conf\n```\n\nMake sure the file looks like this:\n\n```\n<Directory \"/Users/your_user_name/Sites/\">\nOptions Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks\nAllowOverride All AuthConfig\nOrder allow,deny\nAllow from all\n</Directory>\n```\n\nSave and close that file. Then restart Apache (remember the command?).\n\n## Virtual Hosts\n\nOpen up the virtual hosts file:\n\n```\nsudo subl /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n\n```\n\nYou should see a file around 40 lines long, with a couple of virtual host entries. These are sample entries. We're going to be making a number of entries in here and they will depend on how you named your files within Sites. The head of your virtual-hosts file will need a line like this:\n\n```\nNameVirtualHost *:80\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nDocumentRoot \"/Users/ian/Sites\"\n</VirtualHost>\n```\nThen you need to specify the actual virtual hosts for each of your local sites. Here is a sample from my own vhosts file:\n\n```\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/Users/Ian/Sites/wp1.dev\"\n    ServerName wp1.dev\n</VirtualHost>\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/Users/Ian/Sites/wp2.dev\"\n    ServerName wp2.dev\n</VirtualHost>\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/Users/Ian/Sites/wp3.dev\"\n    ServerName wp3.dev\n</VirtualHost>\n```\nYou can see the pattern. All you need to do is create lines like these replacing the directory to your sites folder as well as the folder names.\n\nWithin the VirtualHost block the first line points to the file location on the system and the second line indicates the web address. Meaning that when you type that string into your browser you should get to the folder indicated in line one. So after you input all the virtual hosts you want then you're done! Finally. Now you should be able to input any of these addresses and get to that folder, which is probably still empty at this point.\n\nSo now we should be up and running with PHP. To make sure go to your document root (either the sites folder or the system root mentioned above). Find the file that's currently being served at localhost. It will probably be named something like 'index.html'. Now edit this using either the nano command or any text editor. Here's the nano command on my system:\n\n```\nsudo nano Library/WebServer/Documents/index.php\n```\n\nEdit that file and add the following code to anywhere. Here's what my 'index.php' file looks like. I added an extra paragraph to remind myself where the doc was being served from:\n\n```\n<html><body></p>\n<h1>It works!</h1>\n<p>This doc at: /Library/WebServer/Documents/\n<?php phpinfo();>\n</body></html>\n```\n\nSave the file. Now when you reload localhost you should see all your php info. NOTE: Be sure that the file is a .php file. I think by default it will be a .html file so you may need to change it.\n\nIf you don't get the expected page with a big list of php settings then something went wrong. Check the filename, check that you edited the file in the right directory and if that doesn't work go back up and try following from the beginning of this section again.\n\n## MySQL\n\nSo now we have PHP and Apache up and running. The last key ingredient MySQL. To be half-decent PHP developers we need to be able to work well with a database, so even though you could start coding PHP right now with the current setup we still need a database. Download it from the <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/\" title=\"download mysql\">MySQL site</a>. Use the Mac OS X ver. 10.6 (x86, 64-bit), DMG Archive version (works fine on 10.8). Install everything that comes in the DMG.\n\nYou can now start the MySQL server from the System Preferences pane or via the command line.<a href=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/e89ea2e5b995e5bfabe785a7-2013-01-22-e4b88ae58d882-14-31.png\"><img src=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/e89ea2e5b995e5bfabe785a7-2013-01-22-e4b88ae58d882-14-31.png\" alt=\"You can start the MySQL server from the System Preferences\" /></a>\n\n#### Set The Root Password\n\nUse this command, and remember the password you use:\n\n`/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'yourpasswordhere'`\n\nNow we're ready for phpMyAdmin.\n\n## Installing phpMyAdmin\n\nIf I wrote up this section I would pretty much just be copying word for word the article that helped me get it set up, so I'm just going to point you there. Here's the link:\n\n<a href=\"http://coolestguyplanettech.com/downtown/install-and-configure-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-osx-108-mountain-lion\" title=\"phpMyAdmin installation\">Installing phpMyAdmin</a>\n\nIf you have read along here you can scroll down to the last section where you will find out how to get phpMyAdmin up and running. This is a very good article and if anything has gone wrong up to this point I suggest checking it out, as I may have forgotten something. Once you get phpMyAdmin set up your done! Now we can get to the real purpose of why were here: Coding PHP.\n\n## Done!\n\n## External Resources\n\nMost of what I wrote here is a combination of various articles I read myself to learn how to make this work. Here are two great articles that talk about setting up your own AMP stack and working with virtual hosts, respectively:\n\n- <a href=\"http://coolestguyplanettech.com/downtown/install-and-configure-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-osx-108-mountain-lion\" title=\"setting up amp stack\">Install and configure phpMyAdmin and MySql on Mac</a>\n- <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-improve-local-wordpress-development-on-a-mac/#.UP43IaFARdQ\" title=\"virtual hosts with wordpress\">How to improve local WordPress development</a>\n","source":"_posts/2013-05-30-wordpress-development-server-full-set-up-guide.md","raw":"---\ntitle: WordPress Development Server - Full Set Up Guide\ndsq_thread_id:\n  - 1337579457\n  - 1337579457\ntags:\n  - web\n  - wordpress\n---\n\n## Unleashing your WordPress Development Server\n\nSo you want to escape inclusive packages like MAMP, learn about web servers and generally code like a boss? Well if you use a Mac your in the right place, but guess what we need before we get started? A local development environment! If you don't know what that is, read the next paragraph. If you do, then skip down. Even if you already have a local dev server set up this will still be useful knowledge should you want to untether yourself from MAMP or any other AMP stack bundle.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n**Windows Users:** This article is about setting up a local dev environment on Mac OSX 10.8. You will also need to get an AMP stack up and running but I'm not familiar with Windows so I'm just going to recommend [WAMP](http://bitnami.org/stack/wamp) (sigh).\n\n## The Local Dev Environment\n\nWhen you code in PHP you need somewhere to test your work as you go along. This is where the local dev server comes in. You will also need a local dev server if you do any sort of online development. What the local dev server is&#8230; is just that: a server that runs on your computer. When you buy web hosting your paying for disk space on someone else's server. That server is running server-side software that let's you do many things, like using PHP and MySQL. So we're going to set up the same thing running from our own computer. This means web files (.php, .html, etc.) on your own hard drive will be hosted and served to your browser. **Let's go!**\n\n### This tutorial\n\nThere are so many tutorials on this subject out there, so why read this one&#8230; I'll tell you: Because most of the rest suck. Notice how I said most. I will refer in this lesson to some tutorials elsewhere that are actually very useful. Also, I will be focusing on setting up a professional dev environment, free of MAMP or XAMP or whatever else is out there. If you've ever seen/used MAMP Pro this is essentially setting up the same thing without a GUI.

Don't worry, we'll get to that soon.\n\n**One last setup step:** You will need to be able to open files for editing _from the Terminal_. You can use whatever editor you want.

Name these folders whatever you want. The point is that each one will eventually contain a full site. Just name the folder something that you don't mind typing into a browser (i.e. something short).\n\n<a href=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/home-folder.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/home-folder.jpeg?w=300\" alt=\"Making the sites folder\" /></a>\n\nThis is the home folder for the user 'admin'.\n\nNow it's time to get serious. We need to edit your computers hosts file so that when we actually type these addresses into the browser they are redirected. To edit the hosts file do this:\n\n```\nsudo subl /private/etc/hosts\n```\n\nOr, if you are using nano do this:\n\n```\nsudo nano /private/etc/hosts\n```\n<p>It doesn't matter what is currently in there, but don't delete anything.

Here's a bit of my hosts file:</p>\n```\n127.0.0.1 ian.dev\n127.0.0.1 wp1.dev\n127.0.0.1 wp2.dev\n127.0.0.1 wp3.dev\n```\n\n<p>You see that I have my personal site plus three development servers.

Then restart Apache (remember the command?).\n\n## Virtual Hosts\n\nOpen up the virtual hosts file:\n\n```\nsudo subl /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n\n```\n\nYou should see a file around 40 lines long, with a couple of virtual host entries. These are sample entries. We're going to be making a number of entries in here and they will depend on how you named your files within Sites. The head of your virtual-hosts file will need a line like this:\n\n```\nNameVirtualHost *:80\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nDocumentRoot \"/Users/ian/Sites\"\n</VirtualHost>\n```\nThen you need to specify the actual virtual hosts for each of your local sites. Here is a sample from my own vhosts file:\n\n```\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/Users/Ian/Sites/wp1.dev\"\n    ServerName wp1.dev\n</VirtualHost>\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/Users/Ian/Sites/wp2.dev\"\n    ServerName wp2.dev\n</VirtualHost>\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/Users/Ian/Sites/wp3.dev\"\n    ServerName wp3.dev\n</VirtualHost>\n```\nYou can see the pattern. All you need to do is create lines like these replacing the directory to your sites folder as well as the folder names.\n\nWithin the VirtualHost block the first line points to the file location on the system and the second line indicates the web address. Meaning that when you type that string into your browser you should get to the folder indicated in line one. So after you input all the virtual hosts you want then you're done! Finally. Now you should be able to input any of these addresses and get to that folder, which is probably still empty at this point.\n\nSo now we should be up and running with PHP. To make sure go to your document root (either the sites folder or the system root mentioned above). Find the file that's currently being served at localhost. It will probably be named something like 'index.html'. Now edit this using either the nano command or any text editor. Here's the nano command on my system:\n\n```\nsudo nano Library/WebServer/Documents/index.php\n```\n\nEdit that file and add the following code to anywhere. Here's what my 'index.php' file looks like. I added an extra paragraph to remind myself where the doc was being served from:\n\n```\n<html><body></p>\n<h1>It works!</h1>\n<p>This doc at: /Library/WebServer/Documents/\n<?php phpinfo();>\n</body></html>\n```\n\nSave the file. Now when you reload localhost you should see all your php info. NOTE: Be sure that the file is a .php file. I think by default it will be a .html file so you may need to change it.\n\nIf you don't get the expected page with a big list of php settings then something went wrong. Check the filename, check that you edited the file in the right directory and if that doesn't work go back up and try following from the beginning of this section again.\n\n## MySQL\n\nSo now we have PHP and Apache up and running. The last key ingredient MySQL. To be half-decent PHP developers we need to be able to work well with a database, so even though you could start coding PHP right now with the current setup we still need a database. Download it from the <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/\" title=\"download mysql\">MySQL site</a>. Use the Mac OS X ver. 10.6 (x86, 64-bit), DMG Archive version (works fine on 10.8). Install everything that comes in the DMG.\n\nYou can now start the MySQL server from the System Preferences pane or via the command line.<a href=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/e89ea2e5b995e5bfabe785a7-2013-01-22-e4b88ae58d882-14-31.png\"><img src=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/e89ea2e5b995e5bfabe785a7-2013-01-22-e4b88ae58d882-14-31.png\" alt=\"You can start the MySQL server from the System Preferences\" /></a>\n\n#### Set The Root Password\n\nUse this command, and remember the password you use:\n\n`/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'yourpasswordhere'`\n\nNow we're ready for phpMyAdmin.\n\n## Installing phpMyAdmin\n\nIf I wrote up this section I would pretty much just be copying word for word the article that helped me get it set up, so I'm just going to point you there. Here's the link:\n\n<a href=\"http://coolestguyplanettech.com/downtown/install-and-configure-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-osx-108-mountain-lion\" title=\"phpMyAdmin installation\">Installing phpMyAdmin</a>\n\nIf you have read along here you can scroll down to the last section where you will find out how to get phpMyAdmin up and running. This is a very good article and if anything has gone wrong up to this point I suggest checking it out, as I may have forgotten something. Once you get phpMyAdmin set up your done! Now we can get to the real purpose of why were here: Coding PHP.\n\n## Done!\n\n## External Resources\n\nMost of what I wrote here is a combination of various articles I read myself to learn how to make this work. Here are two great articles that talk about setting up your own AMP stack and working with virtual hosts, respectively:\n\n- <a href=\"http://coolestguyplanettech.com/downtown/install-and-configure-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-osx-108-mountain-lion\" title=\"setting up amp stack\">Install and configure phpMyAdmin and MySql on Mac</a>\n- <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-improve-local-wordpress-development-on-a-mac/#.UP43IaFARdQ\" title=\"virtual hosts with wordpress\">How to improve local WordPress development</a>\n","slug":"wordpress-development-server-full-set-up-guide","published":1,"date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","updated":"2016-11-12T18:43:49.000Z","_id":"civfj5ihe000khq89r4xoxw15","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<h2 id=\"Unleashing-your-WordPress-Development-Server\"><a href=\"#Unleashing-your-WordPress-Development-Server\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Unleashing your WordPress Development Server\"></a>Unleashing your WordPress Development Server</h2><p>So you want to escape inclusive packages like MAMP, learn about web servers and generally code like a boss? Well if you use a Mac your in the right place, but guess what we need before we get started? A local development environment! If you don’t know what that is, read the next paragraph. If you do, then skip down. Even if you already have a local dev server set up this will still be useful knowledge should you want to untether yourself from MAMP or any other AMP stack bundle.</p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><strong>Windows Users:</strong> This article is about setting up a local dev environment on Mac OSX 10.8. You will also need to get an AMP stack up and running but I’m not familiar with Windows so I’m just going to recommend <a href=\"http://bitnami.org/stack/wamp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">WAMP</a> (sigh).</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Local-Dev-Environment\"><a href=\"#The-Local-Dev-Environment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Local Dev Environment\"></a>The Local Dev Environment</h2><p>When you code in PHP you need somewhere to test your work as you go along. This is where the local dev server comes in. You will also need a local dev server if you do any sort of online development. What the local dev server is&#8230; is just that: a server that runs on your computer. When you buy web hosting your paying for disk space on someone else’s server. That server is running server-side software that let’s you do many things, like using PHP and MySQL. So we’re going to set up the same thing running from our own computer. This means web files (.php, .html, etc.) on your own hard drive will be hosted and served to your browser. <strong>Let’s go!</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"This-tutorial\"><a href=\"#This-tutorial\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"This tutorial\"></a>This tutorial</h3><p>There are so many tutorials on this subject out there, so why read this one&#8230; I’ll tell you: Because most of the rest suck. Notice how I said most. I will refer in this lesson to some tutorials elsewhere that are actually very useful. Also, I will be focusing on setting up a professional dev environment, free of MAMP or XAMP or whatever else is out there. If you’ve ever seen/used MAMP Pro this is essentially setting up the same thing without a GUI. And my way is free!</p>\n<p>There is also the added benefit that you get to better understand your server, learn a bit of terminal and in the end feel a huge sense of accomplishment (maybe). So with that, let’s see what we will need to get started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Necessary-Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Necessary-Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Necessary Ingredients\"></a>Necessary Ingredients</h3><p>Todays recipe is fairly simple in prep, more difficult later on in pickup. Her’s what we need (follow the links to download):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>phpMyAdmin (maybe not ‘required’ but you want it)</li>\n<li>MySQL</li>\n<li>An open Terminal window (../Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This tutorial is for Mac OSX 10.8. I’ve seen it work on 10.6 and 10.7 but you may run into bugs that I don’t solve in this post.</p>\n<p>Now let’s get cooking! The first step is in Terminal. Before we really delve in we want to make a backup copy of the files we’re going to edit. Skip this step if you like, but do so at your own peril. I don’t want to see angry comments later saying I broke your machine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Step-0-Setup-Backup\"><a href=\"#Step-0-Setup-Backup\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Step 0: Setup / Backup\"></a>Step 0: Setup / Backup</h3><p>If it doesn’t already exit, make a file under your home directory called <code>Sites</code>. This is going to be the root of your server, and where you will store all your sites. In this new folder make another folder called something like ‘server-backup’. This is where we will backup to.</p>\n<p>The three files we will be editing are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>httpd.conf</code></li>\n<li><code>httpd-vhosts.conf</code></li>\n<li><code>[username].conf</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>That last one is specific to you. During this post if I write ‘[username]’ what I mean is your own username on the system. You can find this if you don’t know it by typing <code>whoami</code> into terminal and hitting return.</p>\n<p>So to backup these files do the following commands.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>cp /etc/apache2/httpd.conf ~/Sites/server-backup</code></li>\n<li><code>cp /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf ~/Sites/server-backup</code></li>\n<li><code>cp /etc/apache2/users/[username].conf ~/Sites/server-backup</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>That last command may or may not work because you may not have created the [username].conf file yet. Don’t worry, we’ll get to that soon.</p>\n<p><strong>One last setup step:</strong> You will need to be able to open files for editing <em>from the Terminal</em>. You can use whatever editor you want. My favorite is <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Sublime Text 2</a>. I wrote a quick <a href=\"http://iansinnott.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">writeup on SB2</a> that you can check out if your interested. To see how to set up sublime for terminal use, check out this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/artero/1236170\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Gist on GitHub</a>. If you don’t want to do anything like that and just want to get moving, use nano. It’s built in to Terminal. Use it by typing something like the following:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">nano [filename]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Where ‘[filename]’ would be the file you want to open and edit. It’s a bit esoteric so I don’t recommend it, but it’s built into your computer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Step-1-Enabling-Apache\"><a href=\"#Step-1-Enabling-Apache\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Step 1: Enabling Apache\"></a>Step 1: Enabling Apache</h3><p>Open up Terminal. Then use the following command to start Apache:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo apachectl start</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now fire up your favorite browser and make sure everything is in order. In the nav bar type <a href=\"http://localhost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://localhost</a>. You should see something like this displaying the text &#8220;It Works!&#8221;:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://coolestguyplanettech.com/downtown/sites/default/files/itworks.png\" alt=\"it works apache\"></p>\n<p>Now that we’re all set there, let’s see what we’re looking at. Localhost is the default web root for your local server. The file being displayed can be found here:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">/Library/WebServer/Documents/</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This is the system root, but we want to get your user root directory running properly. That’s the next step.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-User-Root\"><a href=\"#The-User-Root\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The User Root\"></a>The User Root</h3><p>Remember the ‘Sites’ folder you created? Open finder and get to it. If you haven’t made that file yet for some reason, create it now and name it ‘Sites’. Here’s a pic I pulled from Google. You can see the Sites folder at the bottom.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Set-Up-Development-Folders\"><a href=\"#Set-Up-Development-Folders\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Set Up Development Folders\"></a>Set Up Development Folders</h4><p>Now within the Sites folder you need to create all the folders you want to be able to serve to your local browser. You can make as many as you want. For instance, my sites folder contains wp1.dev, wp2.dev, etc. I also have a folder named ian.dev where I keep the local installation of my personal site for editing. Name these folders whatever you want. The point is that each one will eventually contain a full site. Just name the folder something that you don’t mind typing into a browser (i.e. something short).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/home-folder.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/home-folder.jpeg?w=300\" alt=\"Making the sites folder\"></a></p>\n<p>This is the home folder for the user ‘admin’.</p>\n<p>Now it’s time to get serious. We need to edit your computers hosts file so that when we actually type these addresses into the browser they are redirected. To edit the hosts file do this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo subl /private/etc/hosts</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Or, if you are using nano do this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo nano /private/etc/hosts</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>It doesn’t matter what is currently in there, but don’t delete anything. What were going to do is add some lines to the bottom. You need to add ‘127.0.0.1&#8242; followed by the name of one of the folders you just created. So for my wp1.dev site I have a line in my hosts file that reads ‘127.0.0.1 wp1.dev’. Here’s a bit of my hosts file:</p><br><figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">127.0.0.1 ian.dev</div><div class=\"line\">127.0.0.1 wp1.dev</div><div class=\"line\">127.0.0.1 wp2.dev</div><div class=\"line\">127.0.0.1 wp3.dev</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><br><br><p>You see that I have my personal site plus three development servers. This list actually goes all the way to wp15.dev, but you get the point. I recommend creating more of these aliases than you think you will need so you don’t have to come back and edit hosts later. As I’ll show you in a bit, this allows me to simply create a new folder in Sites with one of these names and bam! a new site is good to go. Now save hosts and exit Sublime or whatever text editor your in.</p><br><p>Jump into Terminal and do the following two commands:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">cd /etc/apache2/users</div><div class=\"line\">sudo nano username.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>You will need to enter your password to use sudo commands. For anyone not familiar with the Terminal, the first line gets us to the right folder and the second line opens up the file for editing. Past in the following, but remember to put your username in the place of ‘your_user_name’. For me it’s /Users/Ian/Sites/:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;Directory &quot;/Users/ian/Sites/&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks</div><div class=\"line\">AllowOverride All AuthConfig</div><div class=\"line\">Order allow,deny</div><div class=\"line\">Allow from all</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/Directory&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now save the changes and close out of nano. Your editing window will show you the hotkeys you need at the bottom. It will probably prompt you to name your file when you save. Keep the name unchanged so that we overwrite the original.</p>\n<p>Now check the permissions on the file you just edited. To do that type <code>ls -lah</code> in Terminal. As long as you’re in the right directory already, it should look something like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  148 12 28 21:11 username.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>If the permissions come up with anything other than <code>-rw-r--r--</code> use this next command to fix them:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo chmod 644 username.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Remember you can’t just copy and paste that. You need to write in your own username. Now restart Apache. You will need to use this command several more times so keep it on hand.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo apachectl restart</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"Setting-Up-PHP-editing-httpd-conf\"><a href=\"#Setting-Up-PHP-editing-httpd-conf\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Setting Up PHP (editing httpd.conf)\"></a>Setting Up PHP (editing httpd.conf)</h2><p>Finally! We’re going to get PHP running. This is actually super simple. All we have to do is uncomment a line in our Apache config file. Before we do that I will say again: <strong>BE CAREFUL!</strong> This file is one of those system files that can seriously break things if not handled with care. If you have been following from the beginning you already backed this file up, so your all set. Alright, back to it. Do this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now find and uncomment the following line:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>When within nano, you can use the ‘control + W’ hotkey to search the document. After you remove the ‘#’ and save the file that’s it, PHP is enabled. However, I’m going to suggest you don’t close out of httpd.conf just yet. Let’s make a few more changes while were here.</p>\n<p>Move down a number of lines to roughly 130. You should see two lines of code for User and Group. Comment the existing lines and input your own username and the group name staff. It should look like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">#User _www</div><div class=\"line\">#Group _www</div><div class=\"line\">User username</div><div class=\"line\">Group staff</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This makes Apache run as you, meaning you will be given full server permissions. This is optional but it may save you trouble later. For me it was needed to allow local WordPress installations to download and install plugins/themes from the back end. I’ll also remind you again to make user you replace ‘username’ with your own user name. If you’re having an identity crisis, use the <code>whoami</code> command.</p>\n<p>Now find the following line of code via search (ctrl+w in nano):</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">#Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Remove the pound sign to uncomment. This enables the virtual hosts file which is necessary to turn our folders within Sites into local websites.</p>\n<p>Finally, search for the text “AllowOverride”. This will bring you to a comment block describing “what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.” This is what you’re after. Change the line <code>AllowOverride None</code> to <code>AllowOverride All</code>. Save and close your httpd.conf file, hopefully you will never have to touch it again.</p>\n<p><strong>The User.conf File</strong></p>\n<p>Next we need to edit a user specific file. In terminal do the following, replacing username with your user name:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo nano /private/etc/apache2/users/Ian.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Make sure the file looks like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;Directory &quot;/Users/your_user_name/Sites/&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks</div><div class=\"line\">AllowOverride All AuthConfig</div><div class=\"line\">Order allow,deny</div><div class=\"line\">Allow from all</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/Directory&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Save and close that file. Then restart Apache (remember the command?).</p>\n<h2 id=\"Virtual-Hosts\"><a href=\"#Virtual-Hosts\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Virtual Hosts\"></a>Virtual Hosts</h2><p>Open up the virtual hosts file:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo subl /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>You should see a file around 40 lines long, with a couple of virtual host entries. These are sample entries. We’re going to be making a number of entries in here and they will depend on how you named your files within Sites. The head of your virtual-hosts file will need a line like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">NameVirtualHost *:80</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">DocumentRoot &quot;/Users/ian/Sites&quot;</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Then you need to specify the actual virtual hosts for each of your local sites. Here is a sample from my own vhosts file:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    DocumentRoot &quot;/Users/Ian/Sites/wp1.dev&quot;</div><div class=\"line\">    ServerName wp1.dev</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    DocumentRoot &quot;/Users/Ian/Sites/wp2.dev&quot;</div><div class=\"line\">    ServerName wp2.dev</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    DocumentRoot &quot;/Users/Ian/Sites/wp3.dev&quot;</div><div class=\"line\">    ServerName wp3.dev</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>You can see the pattern. All you need to do is create lines like these replacing the directory to your sites folder as well as the folder names.</p>\n<p>Within the VirtualHost block the first line points to the file location on the system and the second line indicates the web address. Meaning that when you type that string into your browser you should get to the folder indicated in line one. So after you input all the virtual hosts you want then you’re done! Finally. Now you should be able to input any of these addresses and get to that folder, which is probably still empty at this point.</p>\n<p>So now we should be up and running with PHP. To make sure go to your document root (either the sites folder or the system root mentioned above). Find the file that’s currently being served at localhost. It will probably be named something like ‘index.html’. Now edit this using either the nano command or any text editor.

If you do, then skip down. Even if you already have a local dev server set up this will still be useful knowledge should you want to untether yourself from MAMP or any other AMP stack bundle.</p>","more":"<p><strong>Windows Users:</strong> This article is about setting up a local dev environment on Mac OSX 10.8. You will also need to get an AMP stack up and running but I’m not familiar with Windows so I’m just going to recommend <a href=\"http://bitnami.org/stack/wamp\">WAMP</a> (sigh).</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Local-Dev-Environment\"><a href=\"#The-Local-Dev-Environment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Local Dev Environment\"></a>The Local Dev Environment</h2><p>When you code in PHP you need somewhere to test your work as you go along. This is where the local dev server comes in. You will also need a local dev server if you do any sort of online development. What the local dev server is&#8230; is just that: a server that runs on your computer. When you buy web hosting your paying for disk space on someone else’s server. That server is running server-side software that let’s you do many things, like using PHP and MySQL. So we’re going to set up the same thing running from our own computer. This means web files (.php, .html, etc.) on your own hard drive will be hosted and served to your browser. <strong>Let’s go!</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"This-tutorial\"><a href=\"#This-tutorial\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"This tutorial\"></a>This tutorial</h3><p>There are so many tutorials on this subject out there, so why read this one&#8230; I’ll tell you: Because most of the rest suck. Notice how I said most. I will refer in this lesson to some tutorials elsewhere that are actually very useful. Also, I will be focusing on setting up a professional dev environment, free of MAMP or XAMP or whatever else is out there. If you’ve ever seen/used MAMP Pro this is essentially setting up the same thing without a GUI. And my way is free!</p>\n<p>There is also the added benefit that you get to better understand your server, learn a bit of terminal and in the end feel a huge sense of accomplishment (maybe). So with that, let’s see what we will need to get started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Necessary-Ingredients\"><a href=\"#Necessary-Ingredients\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Necessary Ingredients\"></a>Necessary Ingredients</h3><p>Todays recipe is fairly simple in prep, more difficult later on in pickup. Her’s what we need (follow the links to download):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>phpMyAdmin (maybe not ‘required’ but you want it)</li>\n<li>MySQL</li>\n<li>An open Terminal window (../Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This tutorial is for Mac OSX 10.8. I’ve seen it work on 10.6 and 10.7 but you may run into bugs that I don’t solve in this post.</p>\n<p>Now let’s get cooking! The first step is in Terminal. Before we really delve in we want to make a backup copy of the files we’re going to edit. Skip this step if you like, but do so at your own peril. I don’t want to see angry comments later saying I broke your machine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Step-0-Setup-Backup\"><a href=\"#Step-0-Setup-Backup\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Step 0: Setup / Backup\"></a>Step 0: Setup / Backup</h3><p>If it doesn’t already exit, make a file under your home directory called <code>Sites</code>. This is going to be the root of your server, and where you will store all your sites. In this new folder make another folder called something like ‘server-backup’. This is where we will backup to.</p>\n<p>The three files we will be editing are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>httpd.conf</code></li>\n<li><code>httpd-vhosts.conf</code></li>\n<li><code>[username].conf</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>That last one is specific to you. During this post if I write ‘[username]’ what I mean is your own username on the system. You can find this if you don’t know it by typing <code>whoami</code> into terminal and hitting return.</p>\n<p>So to backup these files do the following commands.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>cp /etc/apache2/httpd.conf ~/Sites/server-backup</code></li>\n<li><code>cp /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf ~/Sites/server-backup</code></li>\n<li><code>cp /etc/apache2/users/[username].conf ~/Sites/server-backup</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>That last command may or may not work because you may not have created the [username].conf file yet. Don’t worry, we’ll get to that soon.</p>\n<p><strong>One last setup step:</strong> You will need to be able to open files for editing <em>from the Terminal</em>. You can use whatever editor you want. My favorite is <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/2\">Sublime Text 2</a>. I wrote a quick <a href=\"http://iansinnott.com\">writeup on SB2</a> that you can check out if your interested. To see how to set up sublime for terminal use, check out this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/artero/1236170\">Gist on GitHub</a>. If you don’t want to do anything like that and just want to get moving, use nano. It’s built in to Terminal. Use it by typing something like the following:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">nano [filename]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Where ‘[filename]’ would be the file you want to open and edit. It’s a bit esoteric so I don’t recommend it, but it’s built into your computer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Step-1-Enabling-Apache\"><a href=\"#Step-1-Enabling-Apache\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Step 1: Enabling Apache\"></a>Step 1: Enabling Apache</h3><p>Open up Terminal. Then use the following command to start Apache:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo apachectl start</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now fire up your favorite browser and make sure everything is in order. In the nav bar type <a href=\"http://localhost\">http://localhost</a>. You should see something like this displaying the text &#8220;It Works!&#8221;:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://coolestguyplanettech.com/downtown/sites/default/files/itworks.png\" alt=\"it works apache\" /></p>\n<p>Now that we’re all set there, let’s see what we’re looking at. Localhost is the default web root for your local server. The file being displayed can be found here:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">/Library/WebServer/Documents/</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This is the system root, but we want to get your user root directory running properly. That’s the next step.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-User-Root\"><a href=\"#The-User-Root\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The User Root\"></a>The User Root</h3><p>Remember the ‘Sites’ folder you created? Open finder and get to it. If you haven’t made that file yet for some reason, create it now and name it ‘Sites’. Here’s a pic I pulled from Google. You can see the Sites folder at the bottom.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Set-Up-Development-Folders\"><a href=\"#Set-Up-Development-Folders\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Set Up Development Folders\"></a>Set Up Development Folders</h4><p>Now within the Sites folder you need to create all the folders you want to be able to serve to your local browser. You can make as many as you want. For instance, my sites folder contains wp1.dev, wp2.dev, etc. I also have a folder named ian.dev where I keep the local installation of my personal site for editing. Name these folders whatever you want. The point is that each one will eventually contain a full site. Just name the folder something that you don’t mind typing into a browser (i.e. something short).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/home-folder.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/home-folder.jpeg?w=300\" alt=\"Making the sites folder\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is the home folder for the user ‘admin’.</p>\n<p>Now it’s time to get serious. We need to edit your computers hosts file so that when we actually type these addresses into the browser they are redirected. To edit the hosts file do this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo subl /private/etc/hosts</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Or, if you are using nano do this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo nano /private/etc/hosts</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>It doesn’t matter what is currently in there, but don’t delete anything. What were going to do is add some lines to the bottom. You need to add ‘127.0.0.1&#8242; followed by the name of one of the folders you just created. So for my wp1.dev site I have a line in my hosts file that reads ‘127.0.0.1 wp1.dev’. Here’s a bit of my hosts file:</p><br><figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">127.0.0.1 ian.dev</div><div class=\"line\">127.0.0.1 wp1.dev</div><div class=\"line\">127.0.0.1 wp2.dev</div><div class=\"line\">127.0.0.1 wp3.dev</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><br><br><p>You see that I have my personal site plus three development servers. This list actually goes all the way to wp15.dev, but you get the point. I recommend creating more of these aliases than you think you will need so you don’t have to come back and edit hosts later. As I’ll show you in a bit, this allows me to simply create a new folder in Sites with one of these names and bam! a new site is good to go. Now save hosts and exit Sublime or whatever text editor your in.</p><br><p>Jump into Terminal and do the following two commands:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">cd /etc/apache2/users</div><div class=\"line\">sudo nano username.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>You will need to enter your password to use sudo commands. For anyone not familiar with the Terminal, the first line gets us to the right folder and the second line opens up the file for editing. Past in the following, but remember to put your username in the place of ‘your_user_name’. For me it’s /Users/Ian/Sites/:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;Directory &quot;/Users/ian/Sites/&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks</div><div class=\"line\">AllowOverride All AuthConfig</div><div class=\"line\">Order allow,deny</div><div class=\"line\">Allow from all</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/Directory&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now save the changes and close out of nano. Your editing window will show you the hotkeys you need at the bottom. It will probably prompt you to name your file when you save. Keep the name unchanged so that we overwrite the original.</p>\n<p>Now check the permissions on the file you just edited. To do that type <code>ls -lah</code> in Terminal. As long as you’re in the right directory already, it should look something like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  148 12 28 21:11 username.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>If the permissions come up with anything other than <code>-rw-r--r--</code> use this next command to fix them:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo chmod 644 username.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Remember you can’t just copy and paste that. You need to write in your own username. Now restart Apache. You will need to use this command several more times so keep it on hand.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo apachectl restart</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"Setting-Up-PHP-editing-httpd-conf\"><a href=\"#Setting-Up-PHP-editing-httpd-conf\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Setting Up PHP (editing httpd.conf)\"></a>Setting Up PHP (editing httpd.conf)</h2><p>Finally! We’re going to get PHP running. This is actually super simple. All we have to do is uncomment a line in our Apache config file. Before we do that I will say again: <strong>BE CAREFUL!</strong> This file is one of those system files that can seriously break things if not handled with care. If you have been following from the beginning you already backed this file up, so your all set. Alright, back to it. Do this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now find and uncomment the following line:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>When within nano, you can use the ‘control + W’ hotkey to search the document. After you remove the ‘#’ and save the file that’s it, PHP is enabled. However, I’m going to suggest you don’t close out of httpd.conf just yet. Let’s make a few more changes while were here.</p>\n<p>Move down a number of lines to roughly 130. You should see two lines of code for User and Group. Comment the existing lines and input your own username and the group name staff. It should look like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">#User _www</div><div class=\"line\">#Group _www</div><div class=\"line\">User username</div><div class=\"line\">Group staff</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This makes Apache run as you, meaning you will be given full server permissions. This is optional but it may save you trouble later. For me it was needed to allow local WordPress installations to download and install plugins/themes from the back end. I’ll also remind you again to make user you replace ‘username’ with your own user name. If you’re having an identity crisis, use the <code>whoami</code> command.</p>\n<p>Now find the following line of code via search (ctrl+w in nano):</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">#Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Remove the pound sign to uncomment. This enables the virtual hosts file which is necessary to turn our folders within Sites into local websites.</p>\n<p>Finally, search for the text “AllowOverride”. This will bring you to a comment block describing “what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.” This is what you’re after. Change the line <code>AllowOverride None</code> to <code>AllowOverride All</code>. Save and close your httpd.conf file, hopefully you will never have to touch it again.</p>\n<p><strong>The User.conf File</strong></p>\n<p>Next we need to edit a user specific file. In terminal do the following, replacing username with your user name:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo nano /private/etc/apache2/users/Ian.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Make sure the file looks like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;Directory &quot;/Users/your_user_name/Sites/&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks</div><div class=\"line\">AllowOverride All AuthConfig</div><div class=\"line\">Order allow,deny</div><div class=\"line\">Allow from all</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/Directory&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Save and close that file. Then restart Apache (remember the command?).</p>\n<h2 id=\"Virtual-Hosts\"><a href=\"#Virtual-Hosts\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Virtual Hosts\"></a>Virtual Hosts</h2><p>Open up the virtual hosts file:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo subl /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>You should see a file around 40 lines long, with a couple of virtual host entries. These are sample entries. We’re going to be making a number of entries in here and they will depend on how you named your files within Sites. The head of your virtual-hosts file will need a line like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">NameVirtualHost *:80</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">DocumentRoot &quot;/Users/ian/Sites&quot;</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Then you need to specify the actual virtual hosts for each of your local sites. Here is a sample from my own vhosts file:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    DocumentRoot &quot;/Users/Ian/Sites/wp1.dev&quot;</div><div class=\"line\">    ServerName wp1.dev</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    DocumentRoot &quot;/Users/Ian/Sites/wp2.dev&quot;</div><div class=\"line\">    ServerName wp2.dev</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    DocumentRoot &quot;/Users/Ian/Sites/wp3.dev&quot;</div><div class=\"line\">    ServerName wp3.dev</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>You can see the pattern. All you need to do is create lines like these replacing the directory to your sites folder as well as the folder names.</p>\n<p>Within the VirtualHost block the first line points to the file location on the system and the second line indicates the web address. Meaning that when you type that string into your browser you should get to the folder indicated in line one. So after you input all the virtual hosts you want then you’re done! Finally. Now you should be able to input any of these addresses and get to that folder, which is probably still empty at this point.</p>\n<p>So now we should be up and running with PHP. To make sure go to your document root (either the sites folder or the system root mentioned above). Find the file that’s currently being served at localhost. It will probably be named something like ‘index.html’. Now edit this using either the nano command or any text editor. Here’s the nano command on my system:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">sudo nano Library/WebServer/Documents/index.php</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Edit that file and add the following code to anywhere. Here’s what my ‘index.php’ file looks like. I added an extra paragraph to remind myself where the doc was being served from:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;h1&gt;It works!&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;p&gt;This doc at: /Library/WebServer/Documents/</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;?php phpinfo();&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Save the file. Now when you reload localhost you should see all your php info. NOTE: Be sure that the file is a .php file. I think by default it will be a .html file so you may need to change it.</p>\n<p>If you don’t get the expected page with a big list of php settings then something went wrong. Check the filename, check that you edited the file in the right directory and if that doesn’t work go back up and try following from the beginning of this section again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"MySQL\"><a href=\"#MySQL\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"MySQL\"></a>MySQL</h2><p>So now we have PHP and Apache up and running.

Install everything that comes in the DMG.</p>\n<p>You can now start the MySQL server from the System Preferences pane or via the command line.<a href=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/e89ea2e5b995e5bfabe785a7-2013-01-22-e4b88ae58d882-14-31.png\"><img src=\"http://phpbackward.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/e89ea2e5b995e5bfabe785a7-2013-01-22-e4b88ae58d882-14-31.png\" alt=\"You can start the MySQL server from the System Preferences\" /></a></p>\n<h4 id=\"Set-The-Root-Password\"><a href=\"#Set-The-Root-Password\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Set The Root Password\"></a>Set The Root Password</h4><p>Use this command, and remember the password you use:</p>\n<p><code>/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password &#39;yourpasswordhere&#39;</code></p>\n<p>Now we’re ready for phpMyAdmin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Installing-phpMyAdmin\"><a href=\"#Installing-phpMyAdmin\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Installing phpMyAdmin\"></a>Installing phpMyAdmin</h2><p>If I wrote up this section I would pretty much just be copying word for word the article that helped me get it set up, so I’m just going to point you there.

The most simple way is using the keyboard equivalent of the directional keys (I know the directional keys are technically on the keyboard as well, but you will be training yourself not to use them. Just bare with me!).\n\n**Quick Note:** To switch modes between normal and insert mode use the `Esc` and `i` keys. I'm just mentioning offhand in case you feel the need to switch modes immediately. I'll cover modes bellow, just know that you must be in 'normal' mode to move with the keys.\n\n### Vim Directional Keys\n\n* `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` equate to left, up, down and right respectively.\n\nIf you're following along, try it out. It will feel strange at first.\n\n**Here's a tip:** Don't take your fingers of the keys they would usually rest on (`jkl;`). You may initially think you need four fingers on the four directional keys, but you don't. You will find that reaching over with the index finger when you need `h` is not that great a challenge.\n\nThat's cool right? No? I agree. It's slow, but you will probably only use `h` for minute movements of the cursor to the left. You will be surprised how little you actually need it, once you know the rest of the movement keys. Now let's talk about the faster ways of getting around.\n\n### Words, line-search and text-search\n\nTo navigate forward or backward word-wise, use these three keys: `w`, `e`, `b`.\n\nThese all have built in mnemonics to help you keep theme straight.\n\n* `w`: Move forward to the start of the next **word**.\n* `e`: Move forward to the **end** of the word.\n* `b`: Move **backward** one word.\n\nThe capital versions of these, `W`, `E`, `B`, to the same thing but you get bigger chunks of characters with each key press because they use whitespace to differentiate words instead of a set of characters. Don't worry about that for now, you will figure it out without my help.\n\nReady to get crazy? Use `f` and `t` to jump to a specific character on the current line. Use `;` and `,` to repeat forward and backward.\n\n* `fA`: Moves the cursor to the next *capital A* (`A`) in the line.\n* `;`: Move to the *next* occurrence of `A` if that was your last `f` command.\n* `,`: Move to the *previous* occurrence of `A` (I.e. do the same search to the left of the cursor instead of to the right).\n* `t\"`: Moves to cursor to the character *immediately before* the next `\"` in the line. `;` and `,` work just the same as with `f`.\n\n`F` and `T` function the same but do the initial search to the left of the cursor. Consequently, using `;` will consider the next occurrence to also be to the left of the current position, while `,` will be to the right. This can sound confusing on paper, but once you use it it will make sense very quickly.\n\nThe larger implications of these will become more clear later on once we start **deleting** and **changing** text. For now just know that this stuff is important.\n\nNow the real speed booster: text-search. Use `/` and `?` to search for any string within the current open document (buffer). This is *case sensitive* by default. Don't worry, you can change that later.\n\n* `/class`: Moves the cursor to the *next* occurrence of the string `class`.\n* `?id`: Moves to the *previous* occurrence of the string `id`.\n\nIf you've used Sublime Text before, these commands function much like the built in 'Incremental Search' functionality, so you may not be floored by this efficiency. Either way, this is Vim so learn it. Now let's change some stuff.\n\n## Changing and deleting text\n\nAs you noticed with many of the other keys, Vim likes to give you built in mnemonics where possible. Changing and deleting text are no exceptions to this rule. Use `c` to 'change' text and `d` to delete.\n\n> *Change* text.. ?\n\nYeah, changing text tells Vim to delete it, and then enter insert mode so you can enter new text. Thus *changing* the text. You could accomplish the same by deleting the text with a movement + `d` and then entering insert mode with `i`. Let's see some basic examples. I'll use an `*` (asterisk) to show you where the is when the command is typed:\n\n* `This is a *blog` : Typing `cw` will '*change* the *word*'.\n\nSince the cursor is at the beginning of 'blog' this would then change the word 'blog'. So if you first type `cw` followed by `house` the new string will look like `This is a house`.\n\nThe `c` command really shines in my opinion when you want to change text between two dellimeters. So maybe you have some HTML that looks like:\n\n```\n<div class=\"so many damny classes on this div\"></div>\n```\n\n\nBut maybe you decided that many classes is a little rediculous and you consolodated the CSS into a single class called `single-class`. Now to apply this class, normally we might use the mouse to select everythign inside those double-quotes. Unfortunately, that's slow. With Vim, we get to use the awesome 'inner' command to select everything *inside* a delimmiter. Here that delimiter is `\"`. So if we type:\n\n`ci\"` followed by `single-class` get the result we want super quickly:\n\n```\n<div class=\"single-class\"></div>\n```\n\n> Like a boss!\n\nYup. This generally works great with things like `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `'`, `\"` and HTML tags. For that last one, the syntax is `cit`. Think of it as 'change inner tag', and commit it to memory. If you code HTML, XML or anything else with tags, `cit` will become your new best friend.\n\n### Deleting Text\n\nYou can often think of the `d` key the same way you think of `c`, except you don't end up in insert mode. Use `d` when you want to delete a group of text but don't necessarily want to replace it right away. In the above example of `cw`, using `dw` instead would have simply deleted the word. I often find `d` works wonders when combined with inline-search using `t` or `f`. Example:\n\n```\n$var = func(nested_fun($other_var));\n```\n\nGiven a line like that above, how would you go about deleting everything after the `=` sign? If you're coding in a language that uses a fairly unique line-ending character like `;` then your in luck. With the cursor in normal mode under the `=`, you can type `dt;` to plow through that nested function nonsense and make room for something new. Speaking of which, if you wanted to change the assigned value of `$var` and wanted to save a step, you could use `ct;`.\n\n[1]: http://www.sublimetext.com/3 \"sublime text\"\n[2]: http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html \"Vintage mode\"\n[3]: https://github.com/guillermooo/Vintageous \"Vintageous on github\"\n[4]: https://code.google.com/p/macvim/ \"macvim\"\n","source":"_posts/2013-08-09-learn-vim-code-like-a-boss.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Learn Vim & Code Like a Boss\ndsq_thread_id:\n  - 1585683628\ntags:\n  - tech\n  - web\n  - code\n  - productivity\n  - vim\n---\n\n## Learn Vim and remove the trackpad from your workflow\n\nSince your here, you probably alredy want to learn the amazing editing software that is Vim.

Thus <em>changing</em> the text. You could accomplish the same by deleting the text with a movement + <code>d</code> and then entering insert mode with <code>i</code>. Let’s see some basic examples. I’ll use an <code>*</code> (asterisk) to show you where the is when the command is typed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>This is a *blog</code> : Typing <code>cw</code> will ‘<em>change</em> the <em>word</em>‘.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the cursor is at the beginning of ‘blog’ this would then change the word ‘blog’. So if you first type <code>cw</code> followed by <code>house</code> the new string will look like <code>This is a house</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>c</code> command really shines in my opinion when you want to change text between two dellimeters. So maybe you have some HTML that looks like:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;div class=&quot;so many damny classes on this div&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>But maybe you decided that many classes is a little rediculous and you consolodated the CSS into a single class called <code>single-class</code>. Now to apply this class, normally we might use the mouse to select everythign inside those double-quotes. Unfortunately, that’s slow. With Vim, we get to use the awesome ‘inner’ command to select everything <em>inside</em> a delimmiter. Here that delimiter is <code>&quot;</code>. So if we type:</p>\n<p><code>ci&quot;</code> followed by <code>single-class</code> get the result we want super quickly:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;div class=&quot;single-class&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like a boss!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yup. This generally works great with things like <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>{</code>, <code>}</code>, <code>&#39;</code>, <code>&quot;</code> and HTML tags. For that last one, the syntax is <code>cit</code>. Think of it as ‘change inner tag’, and commit it to memory. If you code HTML, XML or anything else with tags, <code>cit</code> will become your new best friend.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Deleting-Text\"><a href=\"#Deleting-Text\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Deleting Text\"></a>Deleting Text</h3><p>You can often think of the <code>d</code> key the same way you think of <code>c</code>, except you don’t end up in insert mode. Use <code>d</code> when you want to delete a group of text but don’t necessarily want to replace it right away. In the above example of <code>cw</code>, using <code>dw</code> instead would have simply deleted the word. I often find <code>d</code> works wonders when combined with inline-search using <code>t</code> or <code>f</code>. Example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">$var = func(nested_fun($other_var));</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Given a line like that above, how would you go about deleting everything after the <code>=</code> sign? If you’re coding in a language that uses a fairly unique line-ending character like <code>;</code> then your in luck. With the cursor in normal mode under the <code>=</code>, you can type <code>dt;</code> to plow through that nested function nonsense and make room for something new. Speaking of which, if you wanted to change the assigned value of <code>$var</code> and wanted to save a step, you could use <code>ct;</code>.</p>\n","excerpt":"<h2 id=\"Learn-Vim-and-remove-the-trackpad-from-your-workflow\"><a href=\"#Learn-Vim-and-remove-the-trackpad-from-your-workflow\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Learn Vim and remove the trackpad from your workflow\"></a>Learn Vim and remove the trackpad from your workflow</h2><p>Since your here, you probably alredy want to learn the amazing editing software that is Vim.

People assume learning Vim involves a mandatory dive into the deep end. That’s <em>not true</em>, and I’m going to show you why.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Quck-setup-Updated\"><a href=\"#Quck-setup-Updated\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Quck setup (Updated)\"></a>Quck setup (Updated)</h2><ol>\n<li>Download <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/3\" title=\"sublime text\">Sublime Text</a></li>\n<li>Either <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html\" title=\"Vintage mode\">enable vintage mode</a> or install the <a href=\"https://github.com/guillermooo/Vintageous\" title=\"Vintageous on github\">Vintageous plugin</a></li>\n</ol>","more":"<p>Enabling Vintage mode in Sublime involves a very quick edit to your user preferences file. See the link above for the official instructions. Vintageous is actually better, but I believe it’s only compatible with Sublime Text 3, so to install it you have to manually bring it into your Plugins folder for ST3. The creator gives good instructions on his GitHub page. If you know git already this is super simple to set up.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can of course use the real Vim if you prefer, but having access to a full on text editor makes the transition much easier and keeps you from loosing productivity during the transition. Another option for Mac users is <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/macvim/\" title=\"macvim\">MacVim</a>. I’ve never used it but heard good things.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> The people over at Square recently published a great Vim starter kit for those who want to get set up very quickly with the real thing.

The most simple way is using the keyboard equivalent of the directional keys (I know the directional keys are technically on the keyboard as well, but you will be training yourself not to use them. Just bare with me!).</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Note:</strong> To switch modes between normal and insert mode use the <code>Esc</code> and <code>i</code> keys. I’m just mentioning offhand in case you feel the need to switch modes immediately. I’ll cover modes bellow, just know that you must be in ‘normal’ mode to move with the keys.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Vim-Directional-Keys\"><a href=\"#Vim-Directional-Keys\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Vim Directional Keys\"></a>Vim Directional Keys</h3><ul>\n<li><code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> equate to left, up, down and right respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re following along, try it out. It will feel strange at first.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s a tip:</strong> Don’t take your fingers of the keys they would usually rest on (<code>jkl;</code>). You may initially think you need four fingers on the four directional keys, but you don’t. You will find that reaching over with the index finger when you need <code>h</code> is not that great a challenge.</p>\n<p>That’s cool right? No? I agree. It’s slow, but you will probably only use <code>h</code> for minute movements of the cursor to the left. You will be surprised how little you actually need it, once you know the rest of the movement keys. Now let’s talk about the faster ways of getting around.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Words-line-search-and-text-search\"><a href=\"#Words-line-search-and-text-search\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Words, line-search and text-search\"></a>Words, line-search and text-search</h3><p>To navigate forward or backward word-wise, use these three keys: <code>w</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>b</code>.</p>\n<p>These all have built in mnemonics to help you keep theme straight.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>w</code>: Move forward to the start of the next <strong>word</strong>.</li>\n<li><code>e</code>: Move forward to the <strong>end</strong> of the word.</li>\n<li><code>b</code>: Move <strong>backward</strong> one word.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The capital versions of these, <code>W</code>, <code>E</code>, <code>B</code>, to the same thing but you get bigger chunks of characters with each key press because they use whitespace to differentiate words instead of a set of characters. Don’t worry about that for now, you will figure it out without my help.</p>\n<p>Ready to get crazy? Use <code>f</code> and <code>t</code> to jump to a specific character on the current line. Use <code>;</code> and <code>,</code> to repeat forward and backward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>fA</code>: Moves the cursor to the next <em>capital A</em> (<code>A</code>) in the line.</li>\n<li><code>;</code>: Move to the <em>next</em> occurrence of <code>A</code> if that was your last <code>f</code> command.</li>\n<li><code>,</code>: Move to the <em>previous</em> occurrence of <code>A</code> (I.e. do the same search to the left of the cursor instead of to the right).</li>\n<li><code>t&quot;</code>: Moves to cursor to the character <em>immediately before</em> the next <code>&quot;</code> in the line. <code>;</code> and <code>,</code> work just the same as with <code>f</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>F</code> and <code>T</code> function the same but do the initial search to the left of the cursor. Consequently, using <code>;</code> will consider the next occurrence to also be to the left of the current position, while <code>,</code> will be to the right. This can sound confusing on paper, but once you use it it will make sense very quickly.</p>\n<p>The larger implications of these will become more clear later on once we start <strong>deleting</strong> and <strong>changing</strong> text. For now just know that this stuff is important.</p>\n<p>Now the real speed booster: text-search. Use <code>/</code> and <code>?</code> to search for any string within the current open document (buffer). This is <em>case sensitive</em> by default. Don’t worry, you can change that later.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/class</code>: Moves the cursor to the <em>next</em> occurrence of the string <code>class</code>.</li>\n<li><code>?id</code>: Moves to the <em>previous</em> occurrence of the string <code>id</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’ve used Sublime Text before, these commands function much like the built in ‘Incremental Search’ functionality, so you may not be floored by this efficiency. Either way, this is Vim so learn it. Now let’s change some stuff.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Changing-and-deleting-text\"><a href=\"#Changing-and-deleting-text\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Changing and deleting text\"></a>Changing and deleting text</h2><p>As you noticed with many of the other keys, Vim likes to give you built in mnemonics where possible.

I say this because when I look back at older web pages they usually have some distinctive characteristics that instantly grant them outdated status. For instance:\n\n* Table-based layouts\n* HTML-based styling\n* Unresponsive, etc..\n\nI believe full-page reloads will belong on this list before too long.\n\n## No, but seriously\n\nHave you ever used [Ghost][1]? If you haven't, it's a really promising blogging platform that recently got released to the public and has scored six-digit funding on Kickstarter. I'm still using WordPress for this blog, but after a few minutes using Ghost I could say it was a vast improvement. This isn't a review, so I won't get into the specifics except to say that it built with JavaScript, so it runs like an app not a web page.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## The issue with browser reloads\n\nThey are **slow**. That is really all I need to say. I spend a lot of time developing on my local server, where page reloads are as fast as possible, and it still feels slow after a while. Even when all the files are stored locally,there's still an amount of time that must be consumed for the browser to do a reload. And for what? Most elements on a given page, especially a blog, don't actually change from page to page. The header, footer and often the sidebar are all the same page-to-page. So why reload all those assets for nothing? It's a waste.\n\nThe other issue is that they are unnecessary. Through the use of AJAX we can accomplish pretty much anything we want on the back-end without actually reloading the page. Just send the necessary information, parse the response and update the page. Simple.\n\nAdmittedly this might not be *as* simple as just using page reloads but the user experience would suffer. Look at some of the largest commercial websites right now (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and see how many make extensive use of AJAX to minimize page reloads. Google's instant search and maps are both good examples. Twitter uses a ton of AJAX on their pages and Facebook, although still making use of numerous page reloads has decreased the number significantly over the years.\n\n## When?\n\nThat's hard to say.

Even when all the files are stored locally,there's still an amount of time that must be consumed for the browser to do a reload. And for what?

Look at some of the largest commercial websites right now (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and see how many make extensive use of AJAX to minimize page reloads.

The whole video was about how to use [Bash], and then at the very end they recommend that those who want more serious customization should check out something called [Z shell][3].\n\nThat recommendation led me on an all-day adventure learning Z shell customization. The real killer feature of Z shell actually turned out to be the community involvement, and the GitHub users who were putting out easy-to-use plugins for the esoteric shell. The project is called [oh my zsh][4], and it's a great place to start for anyone who wants a more usable terminal.\n\nThe point being, there was recently an announcement on Hacker News that someone had started a [similar project][5] for this new shell called Fish. As soon as I saw that, a big chunk of my time for the day went out the window. I knew if I started looking into the code and the various customizations I would lose many hours of the day, but I couldn't resist. I LOVE improving my workflow.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## One shell to rule them all\n\nLike most developers I spend a lot of time in the Terminal, and it can be a pain. Fish shell actually offers code-completion in the terminal as you type. This is a step up from Z shell which would offer decent tab completion but would not print out suggestions for you as you type. What's not great about Z shell is that much like bash customizing it can be a real pain. Fish on the other hand simplifies customization by making everything a function, and making functions easily definable. Here's an example of one I use often with Git:\n\n```\nfunction gg -d \"Commit all\"\n  git commit -v -a -m \"$argv\"\nend\n```\n\nThe first line defines the function `gg`, and then is passed the optional description option `-d`. This isn't really important, but it provides a nice and easy way to add a bit of text to remind yourself what the hell these two letters do. When you type `gg` into the command line and hit tab this description will pop up next to it. Anyway, the second line is easy, it's just a git command with a few options passed. The only part that has to do with Fish shell is the `$argv` variable which is a &#8216;list' of arguments that you pass. In this case I wrap it in `\"` (double quotes) so that I don't have to do that myself. The third line just ends the block. Now I can type something like this:\n\n```\ngit add .\ngg Initial Commit\n```\n\nAnd my commit is done without having to type the usual annoying `\"` or `-m`.\n\nWhat's also great though, is that Fish shell comes with a predefined function called `alias` that supports the exact same syntax you used in Bash or Z shell. So for all those aliases sitting in your old config file you can just copy them over and be done. Or if you don't have any incompatible code in your alias file (i.e. bash or zsh functions) that would cause things to break, then just source it using the `.` syntax. Sidenote: Fish doesn't seem to support the familiar `source` keyword, you have to use the shorthand `.`.\n\n## Caveats\n\nTwo things I've noticed so far that I'm not super thrilled about:\n\n* Often have to type `cd` to change directory\n* No official support for Vim-like editing on the command line\n\nThat first one is probably customizable somehow but I just didn't put time into figuring out how. It's a feature of Z shell that you can choose to omit `cd` before typing out a directory name and it will know what you mean.\n\nThe second one isn't a huge issue either, because Vim integration with the command line doesn't actually provide any massive boost to productivity or usability. It's nice, to be sure, but Vim really shines when editing longer documents. When using the command line I don't make many typos so most of what I'm doing is entering text not editing it.\n\nThe second one isn't a huge issue either, because Vim integration with the command line doesn't actually provide any massive boost to productivity or usability. It's nice to be sure, but\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo that's it.

In this case I wrap it in <code>&quot;</code> (double quotes) so that I don’t have to do that myself. The third line just ends the block. Now I can type something like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">git add .</div><div class=\"line\">gg Initial Commit</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>And my commit is done without having to type the usual annoying <code>&quot;</code> or <code>-m</code>.</p>\n<p>What’s also great though, is that Fish shell comes with a predefined function called <code>alias</code> that supports the exact same syntax you used in Bash or Z shell. So for all those aliases sitting in your old config file you can just copy them over and be done. Or if you don’t have any incompatible code in your alias file (i.e. bash or zsh functions) that would cause things to break, then just source it using the <code>.</code> syntax. Sidenote: Fish doesn’t seem to support the familiar <code>source</code> keyword, you have to use the shorthand <code>.</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Caveats\"><a href=\"#Caveats\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Caveats\"></a>Caveats</h2><p>Two things I’ve noticed so far that I’m not super thrilled about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Often have to type <code>cd</code> to change directory</li>\n<li>No official support for Vim-like editing on the command line</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That first one is probably customizable somehow but I just didn’t put time into figuring out how. It’s a feature of Z shell that you can choose to omit <code>cd</code> before typing out a directory name and it will know what you mean.</p>\n<p>The second one isn’t a huge issue either, because Vim integration with the command line doesn’t actually provide any massive boost to productivity or usability. It’s nice, to be sure, but Vim really shines when editing longer documents. When using the command line I don’t make many typos so most of what I’m doing is entering text not editing it.</p>\n<p>The second one isn’t a huge issue either, because Vim integration with the command line doesn’t actually provide any massive boost to productivity or usability.

It's become vital to my workflow and I highly recommend it to anyone trying to boost their productivity.\n\nHowever, other parts of my workflow have evolved quite a bit (such as window management). If you're interested in a full post on the subject [drop me a line on twitter][twitter] or leave a comment at the bottom.\n\nNow back to the original article.\n\n[twitter]: https://twitter.com/ian_sinn/\n\n## One step closer to a mouse-less workflow\n\nI'm going to show you how to integrate Alfred with the excellent Keyboard Maestro. Why? Because I have a vendetta against my mouse and I'm constantly finding new ways to remove it from my workflow entirely. To this end, the discovery of [Keyboard Maestro][1] by [Stairways Software][2] was a big win.\n\n### Keyboard Maestro (KM)\n\nSuper quick introduction: KM makes it easy to assign almost any Mac action to an easy-to-use trigger. It's a great piece of software and is backed by a friendly and accessible developer, Peter Lewis. Seriously, go check it out right now if you haven't yet. It's free to try.\n\n### Combine & Conquer\n\nSo, let's be honest: if you you're already a Mac power user, you probably have far too many hotkeys rattling around in your brain already. This is especially true if your a developer. KM is an excellent piece of software out of box, but adding more hotkeys to the list of things you must remember might not be the ideal solution. But if we could just name our macros in a memorable way and then call them up at will based on that name we could do amazing things.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n**Enter [Alfred][3]**. By combining the functionality of Alfred with the system control of KM you can make your Mac do pretty much anything, *very quickly*.\n\n### Setup\n\nTo integrate the two, download the workflow I made for this purpose.\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-download\" href=\"https://github.com/iansinnott/alfred-maestro/raw/master/AlfredMaestro.alfredworkflow\">Download</a>\n\nYou can also [download the source][4] from GitHub if you feel so inclined. Once you have the `KeyboardMaestro.alfredworkflow` file just double click it to install it in Alfred. Done!\n\n### Usage\n\nNow, as long as you actually have KM installed you can type `km` in the Alfred prompt and then the name of a macro. Here's a simple example; I really don't like continually typing out my email, so I made a macro for it:\n\n![Email Macro](https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/email-macro.png)\n\nNotice that I don't even have to assign a trigger to it. This is somewhat of a new feature in KM 6.3, and the reason you must have that version or above. This is a great feature as it leaves room for macros that really deserve their own hotkey and doesn't clutter your mind with unnecessary information. Just type `km` into Alfred and then start typing the title of the macro:\n\n![Email macro example](https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-06%20at%209.15.08%20PM.png)\n\nIf I hit enter my email address will be pasted into whatever text I'm editing. This is great for filling forms online. Another one that is use all the time in this same way is date insertion. I always have to think for a second about what the date is. Luckily KM comes to the rescue:\n\n![Date macro](https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-06%20at%209.18.19%20PM.png)\n\nNow if I start typing `km date:` and hit enter, the date will be inserted in the mm/dd/yyyy format:\n\n![Date macro example](https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-06%20at%209.19.00%20PM.png)\n\nThis example also shows two good examples of the power of KM. First, you get set values, like `%NumberDate%` that you can pass in. Second, when you want/need to, you can also assign triggers that are fully independent of Alfred and this workflow.\n\nTo start making your own crazy macros, you should hit the KM docs. I'll point you specifically to the [calculations section][5], where you can dive into some of the more obscure functionality (like the `SCREEN` function for manipulating application screens. Then from there you can check out the other sections about more general functionality.\n\n**One Last Note:** KM is fully capable of triggering macros by name all on it's own. See?\n\n![Keyboard Maestro macro by name](https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-06%20at%209.12.29%20PM.png)\n\nSo if you're not an Alfred user, there is a remote possibility that you can get by with just KM. In fact, if you really wanted to you could probably replicate most of Alfred's functionality entirely with KM, but why bother?\n\nThe other reason to use these two programs together is the Active community behind Alfred. This community means you can usually find a workflow to help with whatever your looking to accomplish. Community involvement however is much more limited with KM. This is surprising, considering the built in &#8216;Export macro' functionality. KM does have an [existing macro library][6], but I'm not sure how many users know about it. That said, this certainly isn't a deal breaker. It's not difficult to make macros in KM, and there *is* an active community that I think would be happy to contribute macros if there was a well-known, central location at which to share them.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nKeyboard Maestro and Alfred make an amazing combination. If you don't have them already, get them now! I myself have <del>just started using it</del> been using it for **well over a year**. I have a ton more functionality planned with this app that I haven't gotten around to implementing (system-wide Vim bindings anyone?). Moreover, as I mentioned before, the developer Peter Lewis is very accessible. When I first showed him how my workflow was inherently limited by KM itself, he added the necessary functionality and shipped it a few days later with KM 6.3! That's amazing.\n\n**One last note:** If you have any issues with this plugin head over to the [issues section of my GitHub repo][7] and let me know. And if you you find it useful, [starring the repo][repo] on GitHub is a great way to say thanks.

This is great for filling forms online. Another one that is use all the time in this same way is date insertion. I always have to think for a second about what the date is. Luckily KM comes to the rescue:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-06%20at%209.18.19%20PM.png\" alt=\"Date macro\"></p>\n<p>Now if I start typing <code>km date:</code> and hit enter, the date will be inserted in the mm/dd/yyyy format:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-06%20at%209.19.00%20PM.png\" alt=\"Date macro example\"></p>\n<p>This example also shows two good examples of the power of KM. First, you get set values, like <code>%NumberDate%</code> that you can pass in. Second, when you want/need to, you can also assign triggers that are fully independent of Alfred and this workflow.</p>\n<p>To start making your own crazy macros, you should hit the KM docs. I’ll point you specifically to the <a href=\"http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/documentation/6/calculations.html\">calculations section</a>, where you can dive into some of the more obscure functionality (like the <code>SCREEN</code> function for manipulating application screens. Then from there you can check out the other sections about more general functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>One Last Note:</strong> KM is fully capable of triggering macros by name all on it’s own. See?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-06%20at%209.12.29%20PM.png\" alt=\"Keyboard Maestro macro by name\"></p>\n<p>So if you’re not an Alfred user, there is a remote possibility that you can get by with just KM. In fact, if you really wanted to you could probably replicate most of Alfred’s functionality entirely with KM, but why bother?</p>\n<p>The other reason to use these two programs together is the Active community behind Alfred. This community means you can usually find a workflow to help with whatever your looking to accomplish. Community involvement however is much more limited with KM. This is surprising, considering the built in &#8216;Export macro’ functionality. KM does have an <a href=\"http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/macro-library\">existing macro library</a>, but I’m not sure how many users know about it. That said, this certainly isn’t a deal breaker. It’s not difficult to make macros in KM, and there <em>is</em> an active community that I think would be happy to contribute macros if there was a well-known, central location at which to share them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Keyboard Maestro and Alfred make an amazing combination. If you don’t have them already, get them now! I myself have <del>just started using it</del> been using it for <strong>well over a year</strong>. I have a ton more functionality planned with this app that I haven’t gotten around to implementing (system-wide Vim bindings anyone?). Moreover, as I mentioned before, the developer Peter Lewis is very accessible. When I first showed him how my workflow was inherently limited by KM itself, he added the necessary functionality and shipped it a few days later with KM 6.3! That’s amazing.</p>\n<p><strong>One last note:</strong> If you have any issues with this plugin head over to the <a href=\"https://github.com/iansinnott/keyboard-maestro-alfred/issues\">issues section of my GitHub repo</a> and let me know. And if you you find it useful, <a href=\"https://github.com/iansinnott/keyboard-maestro-alfred\">starring the repo</a> on GitHub is a great way to say thanks.

Here are the more important rules:\n\n### Basic private.xml layout\n\nThis is an xml file you can start with.\n\n```\n<root>\n  <list>\n    <!-- <item> Tags Go Here -->\n  </list>\n</root>\n```\n\nNote that `<list>` is an optional tag, but I think it's nice for organization within KRMB. Leave it out if you want.\n\nThe second basic piece is the `<item>` tag. These represent the checkboxes you can turn on and off from within KRMB. They can contain multiple mappings or `<autogen>` tags. Just remember that everything you put into one single `<item>` will be activated or deactivated together. Here's what they look like:\n\n<!--more-->\n\n```\n<item>\n  <name>Item Name</name>\n  <appendix>Longer, more detailed information about the mapping if necessary.</appendix>\n  <appendix>You can add more than one appendix tag</appendix>\n  <identifier>private.unique_name_for_item</identifier>\n\n  <!-- Put autogen mappings here -->\n</item>\n```\n\n\nNow on to the actual mappings.\n\n### KeyToKey\n\nFor mapping one key to another, with potential modifier keys:\n\n```\n--KeyToKey--\nKeyCode::<key we want to affect>, (optional modifier flags)\nKeyCode::<key to fire when pressed>\n```\n\nKey to key mappings always take two `KeyCode`s. The first is the key you would like to remap, the second is they key you would like to remap to. Both can take optional modifier flags. The example bellow remaps the curly braces, `{` and `}`, to nothing.\n\n```\n<autogen>\n  --KeyToKey--\n  KeyCode::BRACKET_RIGHT, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L,\n  KeyCode::VK_NONE\n</autogen>\n<autogen>\n  --KeyToKey--\n  KeyCode::BRACKET_LEFT, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L,\n  KeyCode::VK_NONE\n</autogen>\n```\n\nThat particular mapping may seem useless now, but these sorts of mappings, i.e. disabling a key by mapping it to nothing, are actually very important. After you come up with new mappings for various keys you should disable their former mappings in this way so that you are forced to retrain your muscle memory.\n\n**Note 1:** KRMB doesn't give you key codes for anything that would normally take a SHIFT to type, so to access anything that needs a shift modifier you just specify it as above. `BRACKET_RIGHT` represents `[`, so the combination of `BRACKET_RIGHT` and `SHIFT_L` is equal to `{`.\n\n**Note 2:** I've only disabled mappings of left shift, because I would never hold right shift while pressing a bracket if I wanted to type a curly brace. However, if do hold right shift and type a bracket a curly brace will be typed. Right Shift and Left Shift are completely separate keys so the above mapping only affects what I told it to: `SHIFT_L`.\n\n### KeyOverlaidModifier\n\nThis is the real meat of KRMB and was the real eye-opener for me. This let's us map separate keys to a certain keys &#8216;hold' state as well as a single &#8216;tap'. Here's the syntax:\n\n```\n--KeyOverlaidModifier--\nKeyCode::<key we want to affect>,\nKeyCode::<key to fire when held continuously>,\nKeyCode::<key to fire when pressed and released quickly>\n```\n\nFor example, the Shift keys are essential when typing, but we never tap them once once quickly. They are always held down as modifiers for other keys. This means each Shift key's &#8216;tap' state is essentially wasted. We can utilize this and remap anything we want to that tap, all while preserving Shifts most essential functionality.\n\nWhat you would want to map to Shift is up to you. Steve Losh recommends mapping `(` and `)` to left and right Shift respectively. I totally agree that parentheses are vital when programming and should be easily accessible, but since I've already reversed my numbers and symbols it's actually quite easy for me to hit `(` and `)` where they are. I also like being able to type them both in one quick rolling motion, since many function calls don't take arguments and look like this: `someFunction()`.\n\nSo instead of parentheses, I decided to map `{` and `}`. When writing function definitions or conditional statements these symbols are prevalent in many languages, but they are also very useful outside of coding. On Mac OSX, `Command + {` and `Command + }` are assigned to switching tabs in most apps (Sublime, Terminal, Chrome, etc). So now I can hold Command and hit either left or right shift to navigate my tabs in Chrome (of which there are about 40 at any given time).\n\nSo here's what that mapping looks like:\n\n```\n<autogen>\n  --KeyOverlaidModifier--\n  KeyCode::SHIFT_L, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L,\n  KeyCode::SHIFT_L,\n  KeyCode::BRACKET_LEFT, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_R\n</autogen>\n<autogen>\n  --KeyOverlaidModifier--\n  KeyCode::SHIFT_R, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_R,\n  KeyCode::SHIFT_R,\n  KeyCode::BRACKET_RIGHT, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L\n</autogen>\n```\n\n\nAnd now you see why I remapped my `{` and `}` keys to nothing earlier in the post: to train myself to use the shift keys instead.\n\n### ModifierFlag::NONE\n\nOne last thing to note about KRMB mappings is the `ModifierFlag::NONE` flag, which let's you keep certain mappings from interfering with others. I think of it a bit like non-recursive mappings in Vim. It means I could map a new key to `,` (not sure why you would, but bear with me), but if you hit `Command + ,` it would still open preferences in most applications.\n\nThe example I'm using here isn't going to make sense unless you have read [Steve Losh's post][1] about creating a Hyper key, but here it is anyway:\n\n```\n<item>\n  <name>Backslash to Hyper on hold</name>\n  <appendix>This makes Backslash function as hyper when held, otherwise pipe is fired. This is useful for app launching with hotkeys.</appendix>\n  <identifier>private.backslash_to_hyper_on_hold</identifier>\n  <autogen>\n    --KeyOverlaidModifier--\n    KeyCode::BACKSLASH, ModifierFlag::NONE,\n    KeyCode::COMMAND_L,\n    ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L,\n    KeyCode::BACKSLASH, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L\n  </autogen>\n</item>\n\n<item>\n  <name>Swap backslash and pipe</name>\n  <appendix>This one i'm trying out really, it's not as if I use either of these all that often, but I think writing OR statements happens more often than manually escaping characters. Still, if I was writing a lot of regex I would likely want the backslash back mapped to a single finger key.</appendix>\n  <identifier>private.backslash_pipe_swap</identifier>\n  <autogen>\n    --KeyToKey--\n    KeyCode::BACKSLASH, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L,\n    KeyCode::BACKSLASH\n  </autogen>\n  <autogen>\n    --KeyToKey--\n    KeyCode::BACKSLASH, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_R,\n    KeyCode::BACKSLASH\n  </autogen>\n  <!--\n    This is not needed as the main mapping above takes care of\n    sending pipe instead of backslash.\n  <autogen>\n    --KeyToKey--\n    KeyCode::BACKSLASH,\n    KeyCode::BACKSLASH, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L\n  </autogen>\n  -->\n</item>\n```\n\n\nIn that example I use ModifierFlag::NONE to allow me to do both a KeyToKey mapping and a KeyOverlaidModifier on the same single key.\n\n### Go off and learn more\n\nYou probably have different preferences and needs than me when it comes to how you interact with your computer, so here are some resources you can use to learn more about customizing your system through KRMB:\n\n* <http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/>\n* <https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/pckeyboardhack.html.en>\n* <https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/xml.html.en>\n\n### Update 4/28/14\n\nI realized when I first wrote this I didn't link to my own private.xml file for anyone to look at. Here's the link:\n\n* [Private.xml](https://github.com/iansinnott/dotfiles/blob/master/dotfiles/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml)\n\n[1]: http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/\n","source":"_posts/2014-01-07-using-keyremap4macbooks-private-xml.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Using Key Remap 4 MacBook's Private.xml\ndsq_thread_id:\n  - 2096904275\ntags:\n  - tech\n---\n\nUsing the KeyRemap4MacBook private.xml mappings can be a bit opaque, so I'm writing this as a reference to myself and anyone else that needs to delve deep into customizing KeyRemap4MacBook (KRMB) by using the private.xml config file. Here are the more important rules:\n\n### Basic private.xml layout\n\nThis is an xml file you can start with.\n\n```\n<root>\n  <list>\n    <!-- <item> Tags Go Here -->\n  </list>\n</root>\n```\n\nNote that `<list>` is an optional tag, but I think it's nice for organization within KRMB. Leave it out if you want.\n\nThe second basic piece is the `<item>` tag. These represent the checkboxes you can turn on and off from within KRMB. They can contain multiple mappings or `<autogen>` tags. Just remember that everything you put into one single `<item>` will be activated or deactivated together. Here's what they look like:\n\n<!--more-->\n\n```\n<item>\n  <name>Item Name</name>\n  <appendix>Longer, more detailed information about the mapping if necessary.</appendix>\n  <appendix>You can add more than one appendix tag</appendix>\n  <identifier>private.unique_name_for_item</identifier>\n\n  <!-- Put autogen mappings here -->\n</item>\n```\n\n\nNow on to the actual mappings.\n\n### KeyToKey\n\nFor mapping one key to another, with potential modifier keys:\n\n```\n--KeyToKey--\nKeyCode::<key we want to affect>, (optional modifier flags)\nKeyCode::<key to fire when pressed>\n```\n\nKey to key mappings always take two `KeyCode`s. The first is the key you would like to remap, the second is they key you would like to remap to. Both can take optional modifier flags. The example bellow remaps the curly braces, `{` and `}`, to nothing.\n\n```\n<autogen>\n  --KeyToKey--\n  KeyCode::BRACKET_RIGHT, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L,\n  KeyCode::VK_NONE\n</autogen>\n<autogen>\n  --KeyToKey--\n  KeyCode::BRACKET_LEFT, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L,\n  KeyCode::VK_NONE\n</autogen>\n```\n\nThat particular mapping may seem useless now, but these sorts of mappings, i.e. disabling a key by mapping it to nothing, are actually very important. After you come up with new mappings for various keys you should disable their former mappings in this way so that you are forced to retrain your muscle memory.\n\n**Note 1:** KRMB doesn't give you key codes for anything that would normally take a SHIFT to type, so to access anything that needs a shift modifier you just specify it as above. `BRACKET_RIGHT` represents `[`, so the combination of `BRACKET_RIGHT` and `SHIFT_L` is equal to `{`.\n\n**Note 2:** I've only disabled mappings of left shift, because I would never hold right shift while pressing a bracket if I wanted to type a curly brace.

After you come up with new mappings for various keys you should disable their former mappings in this way so that you are forced to retrain your muscle memory.</p>\n<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> KRMB doesn’t give you key codes for anything that would normally take a SHIFT to type, so to access anything that needs a shift modifier you just specify it as above. <code>BRACKET_RIGHT</code> represents <code>[</code>, so the combination of <code>BRACKET_RIGHT</code> and <code>SHIFT_L</code> is equal to <code>{</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> I’ve only disabled mappings of left shift, because I would never hold right shift while pressing a bracket if I wanted to type a curly brace. However, if do hold right shift and type a bracket a curly brace will be typed. Right Shift and Left Shift are completely separate keys so the above mapping only affects what I told it to: <code>SHIFT_L</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"KeyOverlaidModifier\"><a href=\"#KeyOverlaidModifier\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"KeyOverlaidModifier\"></a>KeyOverlaidModifier</h3><p>This is the real meat of KRMB and was the real eye-opener for me. This let’s us map separate keys to a certain keys &#8216;hold’ state as well as a single &#8216;tap’. Here’s the syntax:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">--KeyOverlaidModifier--</div><div class=\"line\">KeyCode::&lt;key we want to affect&gt;,</div><div class=\"line\">KeyCode::&lt;key to fire when held continuously&gt;,</div><div class=\"line\">KeyCode::&lt;key to fire when pressed and released quickly&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>For example, the Shift keys are essential when typing, but we never tap them once once quickly. They are always held down as modifiers for other keys. This means each Shift key’s &#8216;tap’ state is essentially wasted. We can utilize this and remap anything we want to that tap, all while preserving Shifts most essential functionality.</p>\n<p>What you would want to map to Shift is up to you. Steve Losh recommends mapping <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> to left and right Shift respectively. I totally agree that parentheses are vital when programming and should be easily accessible, but since I’ve already reversed my numbers and symbols it’s actually quite easy for me to hit <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> where they are. I also like being able to type them both in one quick rolling motion, since many function calls don’t take arguments and look like this: <code>someFunction()</code>.</p>\n<p>So instead of parentheses, I decided to map <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>. When writing function definitions or conditional statements these symbols are prevalent in many languages, but they are also very useful outside of coding. On Mac OSX, <code>Command + {</code> and <code>Command + }</code> are assigned to switching tabs in most apps (Sublime, Terminal, Chrome, etc). So now I can hold Command and hit either left or right shift to navigate my tabs in Chrome (of which there are about 40 at any given time).</p>\n<p>So here’s what that mapping looks like:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;autogen&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">  --KeyOverlaidModifier--</div><div class=\"line\">  KeyCode::SHIFT_L, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L,</div><div class=\"line\">  KeyCode::SHIFT_L,</div><div class=\"line\">  KeyCode::BRACKET_LEFT, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_R</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/autogen&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;autogen&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">  --KeyOverlaidModifier--</div><div class=\"line\">  KeyCode::SHIFT_R, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_R,</div><div class=\"line\">  KeyCode::SHIFT_R,</div><div class=\"line\">  KeyCode::BRACKET_RIGHT, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/autogen&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>And now you see why I remapped my <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> keys to nothing earlier in the post: to train myself to use the shift keys instead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ModifierFlag-NONE\"><a href=\"#ModifierFlag-NONE\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ModifierFlag::NONE\"></a>ModifierFlag::NONE</h3><p>One last thing to note about KRMB mappings is the <code>ModifierFlag::NONE</code> flag, which let’s you keep certain mappings from interfering with others. I think of it a bit like non-recursive mappings in Vim. It means I could map a new key to <code>,</code> (not sure why you would, but bear with me), but if you hit <code>Command + ,</code> it would still open preferences in most applications.</p>\n<p>The example I’m using here isn’t going to make sense unless you have read <a href=\"http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/\">Steve Losh’s post</a> about creating a Hyper key, but here it is anyway:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div><div class=\"line\">16</div><div class=\"line\">17</div><div class=\"line\">18</div><div class=\"line\">19</div><div class=\"line\">20</div><div class=\"line\">21</div><div class=\"line\">22</div><div class=\"line\">23</div><div class=\"line\">24</div><div class=\"line\">25</div><div class=\"line\">26</div><div class=\"line\">27</div><div class=\"line\">28</div><div class=\"line\">29</div><div class=\"line\">30</div><div class=\"line\">31</div><div class=\"line\">32</div><div class=\"line\">33</div><div class=\"line\">34</div><div class=\"line\">35</div><div class=\"line\">36</div><div class=\"line\">37</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;item&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">  &lt;name&gt;Backslash to Hyper on hold&lt;/name&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">  &lt;appendix&gt;This makes Backslash function as hyper when held, otherwise pipe is fired.

We went from product idea, to super minimal prototype to finding out our product probably wasn't going to make money all in a week. This is what happened.\n\n## The Idea\n\nA good friend of mine, [Nick Budden][1], had an idea for a product, and after talking about it over the course of a few days we decided to build it. The product would be a unified solution to many of the problems we face as freelance developers. Problems may be the wrong word actually, more like annoyances. The parts of our job that just serve to get in the way and take up valuable time that could be spent creating cool new things. Let's call the combined sum of these annoyances &#8220;Freelance Minutia.&#8221;\n\n<!--more-->\n\nHere was our initial definition of Freelance Minutia, and thus the problems we wanted to solve:\n\n1. Finding work\n2. Getting design feedback from clients\n3. Managing projects and client relations\n4. Bookkeeping\n\nOur big idea was to create **a freelance dashboard that would automate all the annoying aspects of our job.**\n\n## The Motivation\n\nIt sounded great at first. In my own day-to-day work as a freelancer I most often encounter points (1) and (3) above. Finding work sucks, not because it's necessarily difficult but because it usually takes a bit of time, say two weeks to land a new client I didn't know at all beforehand. Then once I landed a client, I would need to keep track of all the various emails we sent back and forth. This is a hassle. Even with separate work and personal email accounts it's easy for emails to get lost in the mix when you have more than one client, or are working on more than one project for the same client.\n\n## The Competition\n\nThere are currently no shortage of &#8216;solutions' to either of these problems in the market. The first problem can be solved to some degree with online job boards. This is after all where me and Nick have both found a significant portion of our past work. But all those various job boards aren't centralized, which makes it a hassle to sift through them all. The other friction point is that far too many of the jobs are complete and utter crap. I could write a whole post on what makes a &#8216;crap' job listing, so I'll try to stay focused on the post at hand.\n\nThen in the realm of the second problem mentioned above, client management, there are endless software & services that pitch themselves as project management software. Basecamp is possibly the most prominent example of such competition.\n\nThe issue with Basecamp-esque project management software in my opinion is that it introduces new friction into one's workflow. As the developer, I must enter new clients in the system, and new clients need to sign up for an account before we can collaborate and discuss the project. If there is anything I have found that clients truly hate, it's changing the way they already work. So introducing this new friction into a projects workflow isn't ideal. The exception is of course clients that already use some sort of software solution, but in my experience they are the exception.\n\n## The Solution\n\nGiven what we knew so far, we figured our ideal solution would be divided into a number of &#8216;modules', each providing different functionality in the end product. The modules were as follows:\n\n* Job Board: An aggregated that would scrape jobs from a ton of sources on the web and display them to our users in a clean, easy to digest format. They would all be tagged with keywords of relevant skills such as *wordpress*, *javascript*, *rails*, etc. They we would only show each user jobs relevant to the skills they had indicated on their profile. Simple.\n* Design Annotation: A portion of the site where users could upload a design mockup, as a simple image file, and clients could add annotation boxes along with text on any area they liked.\n* Client Feeds / Inbox: An area where any emails with clients would be aggregated into simple, digestible feeds that users could review quickly. No more client emails lost in a mountain of other stuff.\n\n## Product Validation\n\nSo, with our product idea relatively clear in our heads and our belief that the competition was missing something we set out to build a prototype. There's no point building this thing if no one wants it after all. We gave ourselves a one-week timebox to get something out to a group of ten beta testers. So we created the &#8216;initial version', if you can even call it that, which was prototype of the Job Board. This was actually just a simple Rails app that would display job titles, how to apply, and a brief job description. All the jobs were added by hand by me and Nick. We created this initial version and sent it out to our testers in three days.\n\nThe feedback on this first part wasn't great. It was all very constructive, but it wasn't overly positive. The recurring theme we kept on hearing was that other people found the majority of their work offline, usually at networking events or by referral. This meant that to them the job board was all but useless. The feedback wasn't all negative, but it wasn't positive enough for us to spend a ton of time creating a scraper and algorithm to find jobs and bring them into our dashboard. This would have to wait.\n\n## Validation Phase 2\n\nNow that we knew the Job Board module wasn't as important as we initially thought, it was time to focus on the Client Feeds / Inbox module. This time, to save even more time spent coding we decided it would be best to just mock it up and send out images of what the finished product would look like. So for the next two days Nick created the mockups while I read up on Rails (neither of us new anything about Rails before starting this project). We sent out the mockups and waited for responses.\n\n**This morning, we reviewed that feedback and came to the conclusion that we need to reconsider the whole project.** All of our beta testers gave long, insightful feedback and suggestions as to how we might move forward along with features they thought would be useful. However, one theme was consistent across all testers: They **wouldn't** pay for this &#8212; Not yet at least. Since what they had seen in the mockups was pretty much what we imagined the finished product looking like, this was a big hit to the validity of our idea. So, as I said before, we've decided to go in a different direction.\n\n## Take Aways\n\nAll things considered, we are both very happy with the past week and what we accomplished. We may not have a valid SaaS product yet, but we know that our initial idea wasn't going to work and it took us only a week to figure this out. It would have been very easy to spend a month or two actually creating this product only to find out no one wanted to use it, so spending a week to come to this conclusion is good time in my mind.\n\nFurthermore, I learned Rails this past week. This is an excellent side-effect of actually trying to build something with a new technology. Unlike tutorials which take you step by step through a process and assume you will be able to replicate it later, actually building something forces you to think through a problem, consult documentation, implement and revise. I may not yet be an expert in Rails but I can already tell it will become the mainstay of my back-end development from here on out.\n\nWe accomplished all of this while keeping up with our individual client projects as well.\n\n## What now?\n\nIn the end, I both don't feel surprised by our testers' responses but I also feel there is value in our original idea.

We went from product idea, to super minimal prototype to finding out our product probably wasn't going to make money all in a week. This is what happened.\n\n## The Idea\n\nA good friend of mine, [Nick Budden][1], had an idea for a product, and after talking about it over the course of a few days we decided to build it. The product would be a unified solution to many of the problems we face as freelance developers. Problems may be the wrong word actually, more like annoyances. The parts of our job that just serve to get in the way and take up valuable time that could be spent creating cool new things. Let's call the combined sum of these annoyances &#8220;Freelance Minutia.&#8221;\n\n<!--more-->\n\nHere was our initial definition of Freelance Minutia, and thus the problems we wanted to solve:\n\n1. Finding work\n2. Getting design feedback from clients\n3. Managing projects and client relations\n4. Bookkeeping\n\nOur big idea was to create **a freelance dashboard that would automate all the annoying aspects of our job.**\n\n## The Motivation\n\nIt sounded great at first. In my own day-to-day work as a freelancer I most often encounter points (1) and (3) above. Finding work sucks, not because it's necessarily difficult but because it usually takes a bit of time, say two weeks to land a new client I didn't know at all beforehand. Then once I landed a client, I would need to keep track of all the various emails we sent back and forth. This is a hassle. Even with separate work and personal email accounts it's easy for emails to get lost in the mix when you have more than one client, or are working on more than one project for the same client.\n\n## The Competition\n\nThere are currently no shortage of &#8216;solutions' to either of these problems in the market. The first problem can be solved to some degree with online job boards. This is after all where me and Nick have both found a significant portion of our past work. But all those various job boards aren't centralized, which makes it a hassle to sift through them all. The other friction point is that far too many of the jobs are complete and utter crap. I could write a whole post on what makes a &#8216;crap' job listing, so I'll try to stay focused on the post at hand.\n\nThen in the realm of the second problem mentioned above, client management, there are endless software & services that pitch themselves as project management software. Basecamp is possibly the most prominent example of such competition.\n\nThe issue with Basecamp-esque project management software in my opinion is that it introduces new friction into one's workflow. As the developer, I must enter new clients in the system, and new clients need to sign up for an account before we can collaborate and discuss the project. If there is anything I have found that clients truly hate, it's changing the way they already work. So introducing this new friction into a projects workflow isn't ideal. The exception is of course clients that already use some sort of software solution, but in my experience they are the exception.\n\n## The Solution\n\nGiven what we knew so far, we figured our ideal solution would be divided into a number of &#8216;modules', each providing different functionality in the end product. The modules were as follows:\n\n* Job Board: An aggregated that would scrape jobs from a ton of sources on the web and display them to our users in a clean, easy to digest format. They would all be tagged with keywords of relevant skills such as *wordpress*, *javascript*, *rails*, etc. They we would only show each user jobs relevant to the skills they had indicated on their profile. Simple.\n* Design Annotation: A portion of the site where users could upload a design mockup, as a simple image file, and clients could add annotation boxes along with text on any area they liked.\n* Client Feeds / Inbox: An area where any emails with clients would be aggregated into simple, digestible feeds that users could review quickly. No more client emails lost in a mountain of other stuff.\n\n## Product Validation\n\nSo, with our product idea relatively clear in our heads and our belief that the competition was missing something we set out to build a prototype. There's no point building this thing if no one wants it after all. We gave ourselves a one-week timebox to get something out to a group of ten beta testers. So we created the &#8216;initial version', if you can even call it that, which was prototype of the Job Board. This was actually just a simple Rails app that would display job titles, how to apply, and a brief job description. All the jobs were added by hand by me and Nick. We created this initial version and sent it out to our testers in three days.\n\nThe feedback on this first part wasn't great. It was all very constructive, but it wasn't overly positive. The recurring theme we kept on hearing was that other people found the majority of their work offline, usually at networking events or by referral. This meant that to them the job board was all but useless. The feedback wasn't all negative, but it wasn't positive enough for us to spend a ton of time creating a scraper and algorithm to find jobs and bring them into our dashboard. This would have to wait.\n\n## Validation Phase 2\n\nNow that we knew the Job Board module wasn't as important as we initially thought, it was time to focus on the Client Feeds / Inbox module. This time, to save even more time spent coding we decided it would be best to just mock it up and send out images of what the finished product would look like. So for the next two days Nick created the mockups while I read up on Rails (neither of us new anything about Rails before starting this project). We sent out the mockups and waited for responses.\n\n**This morning, we reviewed that feedback and came to the conclusion that we need to reconsider the whole project.** All of our beta testers gave long, insightful feedback and suggestions as to how we might move forward along with features they thought would be useful. However, one theme was consistent across all testers: They **wouldn't** pay for this &#8212; Not yet at least. Since what they had seen in the mockups was pretty much what we imagined the finished product looking like, this was a big hit to the validity of our idea. So, as I said before, we've decided to go in a different direction.\n\n## Take Aways\n\nAll things considered, we are both very happy with the past week and what we accomplished. We may not have a valid SaaS product yet, but we know that our initial idea wasn't going to work and it took us only a week to figure this out. It would have been very easy to spend a month or two actually creating this product only to find out no one wanted to use it, so spending a week to come to this conclusion is good time in my mind.\n\nFurthermore, I learned Rails this past week. This is an excellent side-effect of actually trying to build something with a new technology. Unlike tutorials which take you step by step through a process and assume you will be able to replicate it later, actually building something forces you to think through a problem, consult documentation, implement and revise. I may not yet be an expert in Rails but I can already tell it will become the mainstay of my back-end development from here on out.\n\nWe accomplished all of this while keeping up with our individual client projects as well.\n\n## What now?\n\nIn the end, I both don't feel surprised by our testers' responses but I also feel there is value in our original idea. My problems that I mentioned in the beginning of this post haven't yet been solved, so there's clearly room for value to be created. I think the Client Inbox module discussed above hold great promise, and I still intend to build some version of it for my own use if nothing else.\n\nAs for me and Nick as a team, we have decided to take this week for ourselves. We both have more client work to finish up, and I personally have something I want to build before moving on the next project.

Lately I've taken the time to actually learn quite a bit of Vimscript, enough to finally start opening up the true power of Vim. I can customize *anything I want* and create all sorts of new behavior in the editor. But it's really true what many people have said over and over again&#8230;\n\n## There's a learning curve\n\nI would say at the very least it's taken six months to get proficient in Vim. It could certainly be done in less time, but if you're actively working on client projects you will find it hard to open up an editor you don't yet know and be really productive.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n### Modal editing is easy\n\n> I've heard learning the default mappings is sheer pain!\n\nLearning how to use the well-known `hjkl` keys for navigating around the document is surprisingly easy to learn. It just takes a bit of muscle memory, so by disabling your mouse and directional keys anyone could pick this up fairly quickly. I think it took me about two weeks of on-and-off practice, because again, if there's real work that needs to get done it's not practical to spend 90% of your time learning to navigate the document and only 10% actually coding.\n\n> I've used Vim a bit, and became fairly comfortable with simple motions, but it's still slow! Why does anyone like this&#8230;\n\nSo if the mappings are actually easy to learn, what's the catch?\n\n### Vimscript\n\nModal editing is indeed the foundation of Vim's amazing usability, but the true core of it's appeal to so many programmers is it's customizability. That's where Vimscript comes in. If you really want to make your editor do your work for you then you'll need to learn at least a bit of Vimscript. [Steve Losh][1] has written an amazing (and free) [book on Vimscript][2].\n\n## Being Super Productive\n\nSo what does Vimscript allow you to do? **Anything**. At least anything I've had a need to do. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Type `,!` to put `!important` at the end of a css declaration.\n* Type `,{` to go to the closing brace of the current function or block\n* Type `,;` to add a semicolon to the end of the current line\n\nThese sorts of mappings are all in addition to *super* useful functionality that comes either from core Vim or from plugins. An example is the epic [Surround][3] plugin by Tim Pope. That let's you do things like this:\n\n* Type `ci'` to delete everything within two single quotes (`'`) and start typing. This is super useful for change CSS classes, where there are often more than one space-separated classes that need to be changed.\n\n### Ongoing benefits\n\nThe beauty of knowing enough Vimscript to create all the functionality I want is that I no longer have to wish my editor had a certain feature. The instant I realize something could be improved all I have to do is open up a new window and write a bit of code. This level of customization is truly necessary for most developers, and I myself could never go back to using a standard editor now that I have all this custom functionality at my fingertips.\n\nGitHub recently released a [new text editor called Atom][4] that aims to be the best of both worlds. In their own blog post, they even point out the existing polarized nature of text editors: Either they are easy to use, and provide great functionality out of the box (TextMate, Sublime, most IDEs, etc.), or they provide very little of standard text editor functionality out of the box, but are extremely customizable (I.e.

Lately I've taken the time to actually learn quite a bit of Vimscript, enough to finally start opening up the true power of Vim. I can customize *anything I want* and create all sorts of new behavior in the editor. But it's really true what many people have said over and over again&#8230;\n\n## There's a learning curve\n\nI would say at the very least it's taken six months to get proficient in Vim. It could certainly be done in less time, but if you're actively working on client projects you will find it hard to open up an editor you don't yet know and be really productive.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n### Modal editing is easy\n\n> I've heard learning the default mappings is sheer pain!\n\nLearning how to use the well-known `hjkl` keys for navigating around the document is surprisingly easy to learn. It just takes a bit of muscle memory, so by disabling your mouse and directional keys anyone could pick this up fairly quickly. I think it took me about two weeks of on-and-off practice, because again, if there's real work that needs to get done it's not practical to spend 90% of your time learning to navigate the document and only 10% actually coding.\n\n> I've used Vim a bit, and became fairly comfortable with simple motions, but it's still slow! Why does anyone like this&#8230;\n\nSo if the mappings are actually easy to learn, what's the catch?\n\n### Vimscript\n\nModal editing is indeed the foundation of Vim's amazing usability, but the true core of it's appeal to so many programmers is it's customizability. That's where Vimscript comes in. If you really want to make your editor do your work for you then you'll need to learn at least a bit of Vimscript. [Steve Losh][1] has written an amazing (and free) [book on Vimscript][2].\n\n## Being Super Productive\n\nSo what does Vimscript allow you to do? **Anything**. At least anything I've had a need to do. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Type `,!` to put `!important` at the end of a css declaration.\n* Type `,{` to go to the closing brace of the current function or block\n* Type `,;` to add a semicolon to the end of the current line\n\nThese sorts of mappings are all in addition to *super* useful functionality that comes either from core Vim or from plugins. An example is the epic [Surround][3] plugin by Tim Pope. That let's you do things like this:\n\n* Type `ci'` to delete everything within two single quotes (`'`) and start typing. This is super useful for change CSS classes, where there are often more than one space-separated classes that need to be changed.\n\n### Ongoing benefits\n\nThe beauty of knowing enough Vimscript to create all the functionality I want is that I no longer have to wish my editor had a certain feature. The instant I realize something could be improved all I have to do is open up a new window and write a bit of code. This level of customization is truly necessary for most developers, and I myself could never go back to using a standard editor now that I have all this custom functionality at my fingertips.\n\nGitHub recently released a [new text editor called Atom][4] that aims to be the best of both worlds. In their own blog post, they even point out the existing polarized nature of text editors: Either they are easy to use, and provide great functionality out of the box (TextMate, Sublime, most IDEs, etc.), or they provide very little of standard text editor functionality out of the box, but are extremely customizable (I.e.

Just a way to get jekyll to act like a modern web technology when building templates. If you don’t like waiting for your Sass to compile or your browser to reload, hopefully this helped.</p>"},{"title":"Jekyll Management Like a Boss","_content":"\n## Blogging Without Friction\n\nYesterday I wrote a script to help myself blog more often.

Currently my go to app for window management is [Phoenix][].\n\n[Phoenix]: https://github.com/kasper/phoenix\n\n**Update:** The Hydra project referenced in this post no longer exists. It's been succeeded by [Mjolnir][mj], a project by the initial creator of Hydra. So whenever you see me reference \"Hydra\" I'm now actually referencing [Mjolnir][mj].\n\n## I Set Up Hydra to Minimize my Dependence on a Mouse\n\n_This post is about moving one step closer to a mouse-less workflow, where any command can be accomplished trivially from the keyboard._\n\nI discovered [Hydra][hy] through Hacker News earlier today, and it's almost everything I could wish for in a window management tool. My new setup allows me to manage windows somewhat like you see in the image bellow:\n\n[hy]: https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir\n[mj]: https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir\n\n![Keyboard Window Management]({{ site.url }}/public/images/hydra.gif)\n\nIf you interested, [here's the source][source] to make Hydra work like you see in that image. But if you're like me, you will probably want to customize everything, so here's a quick tutorial on how to do that.\n\n[source]: https://github.com/sdegutis/dotfiles/blob/osx/home/.hydra/init.lua#L43-L50\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## init.lua\n\nIf you just downloaded and installed Hydra, you will need to create an init file\nat `~/.hydra/init.lua`. This file will be read every time the app opens and any time you explicitly tell Hydra to reload its configuration.\n\nI would recommend copying in the sample file that Hydra will load if there is no init file present. That file is a great reference for both the Hydra api and Lua.\n\n### Lua\n\nIf you have no experience with Lua and want to set up some extreme window commands with Hydra don't worry. It turns out Lua is a pretty simple language. At least simple enough to write Hydra configuration quickly and effectively. I had absolutely no experience with Lua before today and now I have an effective Hydra setup. To me, Lua's syntax feels like a bit of a middle ground between Javascript, Ruby and Bash.\n\n## Hydra API\n\nHydra exposes a few useful global variables for you, but in my coding the most useful by far was `window`. Everything in my config files started with `window`, so that's what I'll cover here. Here is a snippet to grab the active frame and the screen:\n\n```lua\nlocal win = window.focusedwindow()\n\n-- If no focused window, just return\nif not win then return end\n\nlocal winframe = win:frame()\nlocal screenframe = win:screen():frame_without_dock_or_menu()\nlocal newframe = {\n  x = winframe.x,\n  y = winframe.y,\n  w = winframe.w,\n  h = winframe.h,\n}\n\n-- [Do stuff to newframe before setting it]\n\nwin:setframe(newframe)\n```\n\nThat is a basic boilerplate for most things you would need to do with the active window in the active screen.\n\n### Frames\n\nNot sure if the term 'frame' is preexisting or if it is just something coined by the author of Hydra, but what it really means to the rest of us is a window. This can be confusing since `window` is itself a global variable and it is used to retrieve the active (or focused) frame. Basically, when you manipulate a frame you are manipulating that 'window' in finder. When you resize a finder window with the mouse you are also manipulating a frame. To focus a frame, or make it active, just click on it or use the usual command tab.\n\n### Screens\n\nIn this post whenever I say screen, I will mean the result of calling:\n\n```lua\nwindow.focusedwindow():screen():frame_without_dock_or_menu()\n```\n\nThat `frame_without_dock_or_menu` method is key, because it returns a rectangle that represents the 'usable' part of your screen. That means everything except the top menu bar and the doc (if it's visible). This is important because people can put their doc wherever they like (left, bottom, right) but this function will always return the correct rectangle representing the usable portion of the screen.\n\nScreens also have a second feature. This is a feature I never had a use for so I didn't explore it, but as far as I can tell these are 'Spaces' on a Mac. So if you use a ton of different spaces in your workflow this would be a good place to do some optimizing.\n\n## Example\n\nThat's pretty much all you would need to know to get started. Here some gists taken directly from [my own dotfiles][dotfiles]\n\n[dotfiles]: https://github.com/iansinnott/dotfiles/tree/master/dotfiles/hydra\n\nFirst off, my init file which binds resize and window motion commands to a 'meta' key, which I defined as cmd+shift:\n\n{% gist iansinnott/2cbecf87d9273a0d5918 %}\n\nI put most of the actual logic in a separate file to keep things tidy:\n\n{% gist iansinnott/0c9a0dcba88e6d0de0e5 %}\n\nThat's all.

Well I hadn’t, not before meteor anyway. This framework makes it insanely easy to build apps that update in real-time across an unlimited number of screens, so I love it. Meteor is <em>so good</em> in fact, that it was very easy to overlook what I would otherwise consider to be deal breakers like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full blown app rebuilds, including file compilation, concatenation and minification <em>every time you save a file</em>.</li>\n<li>No official testing solution</li>\n<li>No official package manager</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the first things you will read or be told when starting a meteor project, is to install <a href=\"http://oortcloud.github.io/meteorite/\">Meteorite</a> as a package manager, so the last bullet point is probably pretty clear to anyone who’s used Meteor. However, the other two pain points might be less obvious when just starting with the framework.</p>\n<p>That first one is a really big deal for anyone who likes to iterate on their design using CSS in a browser, and likes to see realtime changes to the web page. These days it’s fairly easy to accomplish this using [Grunt][grunt] or [Gulp][gulp] in combination with [Livereload][lr]. But if you have a large Meteor app, you might have to wait ten seconds (or more!) for your app to reload entirely, even if you just changed a margin or added a 1px border. This is ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Testing has also been an issue with Meteor. There have been a few decent contenders:</p>","more":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://arunoda.github.io/laika/\">Laika</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://rtd.xolv.io/\">RTD</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mad-eye/meteor-mocha-web/\">Mocha Web</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the most part, these are all viable solutions and they are certainly all written by very smart and accomplished members of the community. However, they all fall short in one way or another:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Laika is slow to run, and not great for integration testing with a browser (well, PhantomJS).</li>\n<li>RTD enforces a strict file structure, which is at odds with Meteor’s philosophy of letting you put code anywhere and having it work.</li>\n<li>Mocha web is fine in my opinion (I’m currently using it for a project) but it’s <em>just</em> mocha essentially.

I built the app with Node.js so I chose Mongo as the database. Local setup was easy, I already had Mongo installed. Setting up the production server also seemed easy at first until it just didn't work. Here's I troubleshot it:\n\n## Nginx Error\n\nThe first problem I ran into was an Nginx error page. I forgot the status code, but it essentially meant there was no app running. Strange, since the app was running fine on my local system. Since my application was set to log to stdout I wasn't able to see any information about what was causing the app to error out, so I decided to do a quick deploy to Heroku and see what was amiss.\n\n**Sidenote**: I _really_ like Heroku. If it wasn't so much more expensive than a Digital Ocean droplet I would probably use them for every project.\n\n### Troubleshooting on Heroku\n\nHeroku has a great `heroku logs` command that shows everything an application logged while it was running. As soon as I saw the output I had a face-palm moment: I hadn't saved all my dependencies to `package.js`, so I was getting simple \"module not found\" errors. That was embarrassing, but at least it's a quick fix.\n\nAfter cleaning up my `package.json` file I deployed again and got a database error. Nothing unusual there, I hadn't added a Mongo database to Heroku. This was to be expected, so I decided to deploy straight back to my own droplet.\n\n## Was Dokku Broken?\n\nAfter redeploying I was still getting the same Nginx error telling me that there was no app running. When I ran `docker ps` I saw that was true: Only the MongoDB container was running. Lame.\n\nAt this point I didn't know what to try. I'm still not super familiar with Docker/Dokku for deployment, so I used the good old fashioned method of just resetting everything.\n\nI had saved a droplet image on DO right after installing Node but before setting up Dokku with my SSH key, so I just restored to that image. Then I:\n\n- Setup my SSH key as usual, not using virtual host naming b/c I still haven't transfered the clients main site.\n- Installed the Dokku Mongo plugin and the domains plugin\n- Created a Mongo container using the plugin: `dokku mongodb:create <app>`\n- Created the actual Dokku app from my local server: `git remote add dokku dokku@<ip>:<app>`\n- Deployed: `git push dokku master`\n\nThen everything worked fine. Running `docker ps` now shows two running containers: one for the app and one for Mongo.\n\n## So.. in conclusion\n\nI don't know what went wrong initially, but resetting everything worked like a charm. So when in doubt, just restore to a stable image and start from scratch. And make sure to make snapshots of your droplet whenever you feel it is in a reusable state.

I built the app with Node.js so I chose Mongo as the database. Local setup was easy, I already had Mongo installed. Setting up the production server also seemed easy at first until it just didn’t work. Here’s I troubleshot it:</p>\n<h2 id=\"Nginx-Error\"><a href=\"#Nginx-Error\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Nginx Error\"></a>Nginx Error</h2><p>The first problem I ran into was an Nginx error page. I forgot the status code, but it essentially meant there was no app running. Strange, since the app was running fine on my local system. Since my application was set to log to stdout I wasn’t able to see any information about what was causing the app to error out, so I decided to do a quick deploy to Heroku and see what was amiss.</p>\n<p><strong>Sidenote</strong>: I <em>really</em> like Heroku. If it wasn’t so much more expensive than a Digital Ocean droplet I would probably use them for every project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Troubleshooting-on-Heroku\"><a href=\"#Troubleshooting-on-Heroku\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Troubleshooting on Heroku\"></a>Troubleshooting on Heroku</h3><p>Heroku has a great <code>heroku logs</code> command that shows everything an application logged while it was running. As soon as I saw the output I had a face-palm moment: I hadn’t saved all my dependencies to <code>package.js</code>, so I was getting simple “module not found” errors. That was embarrassing, but at least it’s a quick fix.</p>\n<p>After cleaning up my <code>package.json</code> file I deployed again and got a database error. Nothing unusual there, I hadn’t added a Mongo database to Heroku. This was to be expected, so I decided to deploy straight back to my own droplet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Was-Dokku-Broken\"><a href=\"#Was-Dokku-Broken\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Was Dokku Broken?\"></a>Was Dokku Broken?</h2><p>After redeploying I was still getting the same Nginx error telling me that there was no app running.

As such I asked [my buddy Ravi][ravi] for nutrition advice, and came up with the following daily macros:\n\n- Protein: 180g\n- Carbs: 45g\n- Fats: 90g\n\nThis is a very minimal diet as it comes out to ~1800 calories. The point being, I would put my body at a caloric deficit every day and lose weight. Simple :sunglasses:\n\n### So much protein\n\nSince my normal diet of the past year wouldn't get me anywhere near 180g of protein in a day I needed to make a change. The simplest way in my mind was to just eat more chicken. Easy enough, I love chicken and know how to cook it. As far as sources of protein go, chicken is amazing. It's low fat, has zero carbs and of course packs tons of protein. I live near a large chain store called RT-mart (大潤發) here in Taipei. At RT-mart raw chicken breast is packaged such that 1kg of chicken meat costs about $6.60. Not bad a bad price, so I this became my main source of chicken.\n\nI used all that chicken, along with some veggies and kimchi to make dishes like the this:\n\n![Chicken Meal][one]\n\nIt was going quite well. Meals like that are very low in carbs and fats and super heavy in protein. I continued to make many similar dishes.\n\n![Chicken Meal][two]\n\nThen I made another...\n\n![Chicken Meal][three]\n\nAnd another...\n\n![Chicken Meal][four]\n\nSometimes I changed the salad up a bit.\n\n![Chicken Meal][five]\n\nThe idea behind these meals was great: Eat mostly protein. The problem was, I never took the time to look up the nutrition facts for what I was eating. I knew on a very general level that chicken had a lot of protein, but I didn't know exactly how much. Remember how I was buying chicken in 1kg packages? I would make a point of eating that entire pack of chicken over the course of a day, so 1000g. In 100g of raw chicken there are about 23g of protein, so I was actually getting about 230g of protein a day _from chicken alone_. Then on top of that I was drinking a daily protein shake and eating six eggs for breakfast. Check out this omelet:\n\n![Awesome breakfast omelet][breakfast]\n\nSo with everything tallied up I was getting about 300g of protein _every single day_, well ahead of my goal of 180g. At least I was getting it though.\n\n### Revising\n\nSo my takeaway from all this is that you should always be sure to know what your eating before you put it in your mouth. All that extra protein meant that I wasn't hitting my caloric goals and probably had a caloric surplus most days during the past week. Oh well, lesson learned. From now on I'm going to cut back on the chicken and bring my macros more inline with where they need to be in order to get abs. :poultry_leg: + :leaves: = :muscle:\n\n[ravi]: http://physiquegeek.wordpress.com/\n\n[one]: /public/images/chicken-one.jpg\n[two]: /public/images/chicken-two.jpg\n[three]: /public/images/chicken-three.jpg\n[four]: /public/images/chicken-four.jpg\n[five]: /public/images/chicken-five.jpg\n[breakfast]: /public/images/breakfast.jpg\n","source":"_posts/2014-09-26-road-to-absterdam-part-1.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Road to Absterdam Part 1\n---\n\nMy diet choices have been generally unhealthy for the past year, but lately I've decided I want abs.

The simplest way in my mind was to just eat more chicken. Easy enough, I love chicken and know how to cook it. As far as sources of protein go, chicken is amazing. It's low fat, has zero carbs and of course packs tons of protein. I live near a large chain store called RT-mart (大潤發) here in Taipei. At RT-mart raw chicken breast is packaged such that 1kg of chicken meat costs about $6.60. Not bad a bad price, so I this became my main source of chicken.\n\nI used all that chicken, along with some veggies and kimchi to make dishes like the this:\n\n![Chicken Meal][one]\n\nIt was going quite well. Meals like that are very low in carbs and fats and super heavy in protein. I continued to make many similar dishes.\n\n![Chicken Meal][two]\n\nThen I made another...\n\n![Chicken Meal][three]\n\nAnd another...\n\n![Chicken Meal][four]\n\nSometimes I changed the salad up a bit.\n\n![Chicken Meal][five]\n\nThe idea behind these meals was great: Eat mostly protein. The problem was, I never took the time to look up the nutrition facts for what I was eating. I knew on a very general level that chicken had a lot of protein, but I didn't know exactly how much. Remember how I was buying chicken in 1kg packages? I would make a point of eating that entire pack of chicken over the course of a day, so 1000g. In 100g of raw chicken there are about 23g of protein, so I was actually getting about 230g of protein a day _from chicken alone_. Then on top of that I was drinking a daily protein shake and eating six eggs for breakfast. Check out this omelet:\n\n![Awesome breakfast omelet][breakfast]\n\nSo with everything tallied up I was getting about 300g of protein _every single day_, well ahead of my goal of 180g. At least I was getting it though.\n\n### Revising\n\nSo my takeaway from all this is that you should always be sure to know what your eating before you put it in your mouth. All that extra protein meant that I wasn't hitting my caloric goals and probably had a caloric surplus most days during the past week. Oh well, lesson learned.

It took about two hours to get most things reinstalled and running again, and after the fact I was very happy with the results. My computer is now fresh again, the downloads folder doesn't have 1000 items in it and I have over 100GB of free space (up from ~5GB before)! All in all a very quick and painless experience... until this week.\n\n## Know what to migrate\n\nIt's tough to keep track of everything on your system that's vital to your day-to-day workflow. The toughest are the things that aren't needed day-to-day, but which become vital the second you try do something that depends on them. In my case this was building an android app for distribution.\n\nTo distribute an app on the Google Play Store you need to create a Java Keystore to sign your app with.

It's actually not difficult, but it doesn't seem to have been well documented anywhere yet. Let's get started.\n\n## What you need\n\nObviously, you will need a server running Dokku. I used the Digital Ocean Dokku droplet, which uses the following versions:\n\n* Ubuntu 14.04\n* Docker 1.1.2\n* Dokku 0.2.3\n\nIf you have a different setup your results may vary, but I'm guessing this guide will generally work for you as long as you have Dokku v0.2.3 setup.\n\nYou also need a meteor app. If you are reading this just out of curiosity and don't have an app feel free to use one of the example apps. You can generate them easily through the CLI. Example:\n\n```\n$ meteor create --example todos\n```\n\n## Dokku Configuration\n\nFirst of all, the default buildpack that Dokku will use if it detects a Meteor app is the [Heroku Buildpack][heroku_buildpack], which is not yet compatible with Meteor 1.0 and still uses Meteorite. That's no good, so you will need to specify a custom buildpack for Dokku. The buildpack I've used successfully with Meteor 1.0 is [Meteor Buildpack Horse][horse_buildpack]. As of this writing (11/22/14) the documentation still doesn't reflect that it's compatible with 1.0, but it's worked so far so don't worry about that.\n\nTo specify a custom buildpack, just create a file in your project root named `.env` and within that file export the buildpack URL like so:\n\n```\nexport BUILDPACK_URL='https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse.git'\n```\n\n[heroku_buildpack]: https://github.com/oortcloud/heroku-buildpack-meteorite\n\nMake sure you `git add` your new `.env` file with and commit it.\n\n## Adding Mongo\n\nNow you need to add the [Dokku MongoDB Plugin][mongodb] to Dokku. Make sure you've SSHed into your server, then run the following commands:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/jeffutter/dokku-mongodb-plugin.git /var/lib/dokku/plugins/mongodb\n$ dokku plugins-install\n```\n\nThis may take a few minutes since it will need to install `mongodb-server` on the remote machine, unless you've already installed Mongo in which case it should be quick. Once it's done, start Mongo and link it to your app:\n\n**Note:** In the following snippet replace `<app>` with the name of your application, assuming you've already pushed it to Dokku. If not, push your app up first and then run these commands. Your app name is what you specify in the git remote URL that points to Dokku. It looks like `dokku@yoursite.com:<app>`.\n\n```\n$ mongodb:start\n$ mongodb:create <app>\n```\n\n## Final Configuration\n\nIf you haven't yet, deploy your app to Dokku. It will most likely crash (i.e. You get an Nginx error when you hit your URL), but that's fine as it is still missing one last piece.\n\nThe final step is to set the `ROOT_URL` environment variable in your app container. You need to have pushed your app at least once for the app container to exist. Replace `<url>` with the URL you intend to use for your app. If you haven't yet purchased a domain name, you can set this variable to your IP address and it should still run just fine. Don't forget the leading `http://` (ex: `http://example.com` or `http://0.0.0.0`):\n\n```\n$ dokku config:set <app> ROOT_URL=<url>\n```\n\nSetting the environment variable will trigger Dokku to restart your app. Once it does you should be able to view the app at the URL you provided in`<url>`.\n\n## Success!\n\nThat's it. Hopefully this helps as you deploy your meteor apps quickly using Dokku. If you want to create another meteor app you will just need to run through the above steps again, with the exception of adding the MongoDB plugin.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you had trouble with anything above there are a couple ways you can troubleshoot Dokku and it's containers:\n\n1. Inspect the apps logs. This is likely the most useful troubleshooting technique, and will likely reveal the problem. Run `dokku logs <app>`.\n2. If the logs don't reveal the issue, put Dokku into debug mode and re-deploy. To do this you need to create a new Dokku config file at `/home/dokku/dokkurc`. Add a single line to the file: `export DOKKU_TRACE=1`. Now when you deploy, Dokku will send back _a lot_ more information.\n\n## Useful Resources\n\n* [MongoDB Dokku Plugin][mongodb]\n* [Meteor Buildpack Horse][horse_buildpack]\n* [How To Deploy a Meteor.js Application on Ubuntu 14.04 with Nginx][guide]\n\nThat last link is _not_ specific to Dokku or even Docker, but it gives good insight into what is required to set up a production Meteor server.\n\n[mongodb]: https://github.com/jeffutter/dokku-mongodb-plugin\n[horse_buildpack]: https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse\n[guide]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-meteor-js-application-on-ubuntu-14-04-with-nginx\n\nFeel free to leave comments if you still have questions.\n","source":"_posts/2014-11-22-running-a-meteor-app-on-dokku.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Running a Meteor App on Dokku\n---\n\nThis is a quick overview of how to get a Meteor app set up on Dokku.

I used the Digital Ocean Dokku droplet, which uses the following versions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ubuntu 14.04</li>\n<li>Docker 1.1.2</li>\n<li>Dokku 0.2.3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a different setup your results may vary, but I’m guessing this guide will generally work for you as long as you have Dokku v0.2.3 setup.</p>\n<p>You also need a meteor app. If you are reading this just out of curiosity and don’t have an app feel free to use one of the example apps. You can generate them easily through the CLI. Example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">$ meteor create --example todos</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"Dokku-Configuration\"><a href=\"#Dokku-Configuration\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Dokku Configuration\"></a>Dokku Configuration</h2><p>First of all, the default buildpack that Dokku will use if it detects a Meteor app is the <a href=\"https://github.com/oortcloud/heroku-buildpack-meteorite\">Heroku Buildpack</a>, which is not yet compatible with Meteor 1.0 and still uses Meteorite. That’s no good, so you will need to specify a custom buildpack for Dokku. The buildpack I’ve used successfully with Meteor 1.0 is <a href=\"https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse\">Meteor Buildpack Horse</a>. As of this writing (11/22/14) the documentation still doesn’t reflect that it’s compatible with 1.0, but it’s worked so far so don’t worry about that.</p>\n<p>To specify a custom buildpack, just create a file in your project root named <code>.env</code> and within that file export the buildpack URL like so:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">export BUILDPACK_URL=&apos;https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse.git&apos;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Make sure you <code>git add</code> your new <code>.env</code> file with and commit it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Adding-Mongo\"><a href=\"#Adding-Mongo\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Adding Mongo\"></a>Adding Mongo</h2><p>Now you need to add the <a href=\"https://github.com/jeffutter/dokku-mongodb-plugin\">Dokku MongoDB Plugin</a> to Dokku. Make sure you’ve SSHed into your server, then run the following commands:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">$ git clone https://github.com/jeffutter/dokku-mongodb-plugin.git /var/lib/dokku/plugins/mongodb</div><div class=\"line\">$ dokku plugins-install</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This may take a few minutes since it will need to install <code>mongodb-server</code> on the remote machine, unless you’ve already installed Mongo in which case it should be quick. Once it’s done, start Mongo and link it to your app:</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the following snippet replace <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> with the name of your application, assuming you’ve already pushed it to Dokku. If not, push your app up first and then run these commands. Your app name is what you specify in the git remote URL that points to Dokku. It looks like <code>dokku@yoursite.com:&lt;app&gt;</code>.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">$ mongodb:start</div><div class=\"line\">$ mongodb:create &lt;app&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"Final-Configuration\"><a href=\"#Final-Configuration\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Final Configuration\"></a>Final Configuration</h2><p>If you haven’t yet, deploy your app to Dokku. It will most likely crash (i.e. You get an Nginx error when you hit your URL), but that’s fine as it is still missing one last piece.</p>\n<p>The final step is to set the <code>ROOT_URL</code> environment variable in your app container. You need to have pushed your app at least once for the app container to exist. Replace <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> with the URL you intend to use for your app. If you haven’t yet purchased a domain name, you can set this variable to your IP address and it should still run just fine. Don’t forget the leading <code>http://</code> (ex: <code>http://example.com</code> or <code>http://0.0.0.0</code>):</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">$ dokku config:set &lt;app&gt; ROOT_URL=&lt;url&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Setting the environment variable will trigger Dokku to restart your app. Once it does you should be able to view the app at the URL you provided in<code>&lt;url&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Success\"><a href=\"#Success\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Success!\"></a>Success!</h2><p>That’s it. Hopefully this helps as you deploy your meteor apps quickly using Dokku. If you want to create another meteor app you will just need to run through the above steps again, with the exception of adding the MongoDB plugin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Troubleshooting\"><a href=\"#Troubleshooting\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Troubleshooting\"></a>Troubleshooting</h2><p>If you had trouble with anything above there are a couple ways you can troubleshoot Dokku and it’s containers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Inspect the apps logs. This is likely the most useful troubleshooting technique, and will likely reveal the problem. Run <code>dokku logs &lt;app&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li>If the logs don’t reveal the issue, put Dokku into debug mode and re-deploy. To do this you need to create a new Dokku config file at <code>/home/dokku/dokkurc</code>. Add a single line to the file: <code>export DOKKU_TRACE=1</code>. Now when you deploy, Dokku will send back <em>a lot</em> more information.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Useful-Resources\"><a href=\"#Useful-Resources\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Useful Resources\"></a>Useful Resources</h2><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jeffutter/dokku-mongodb-plugin\">MongoDB Dokku Plugin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse\">Meteor Buildpack Horse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-meteor-js-application-on-ubuntu-14-04-with-nginx\">How To Deploy a Meteor.js Application on Ubuntu 14.04 with Nginx</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That last link is <em>not</em> specific to Dokku or even Docker, but it gives good insight into what is required to set up a production Meteor server.</p>\n<p>Feel free to leave comments if you still have questions.</p>\n"},{"title":"A Site a Day","_content":"\nYesterday I wrote about [teaching my brother to code][last].

One month, that's how much time I have to get him up to speed. Sound crazy? It might be, but that depends on the concrete goal. \"Learn to code\" is far too abstract.\n\n## The Goal\n\nIn one month's time I intend to get my brother up to speed with front-end development. But \"up to speed\" does not mean he will be writing the next front-end framework in just one month. My goal is more along the lines of quickly smashing through the usual barriers people face when they want to learn code. These usually include things like:\n\n* All sorts of mental barriers (\"It's too hard.\", \"I'm starting too late?\", \"Where do I start?\")\n* Frustration\n* Time constraints. (If you have a full-time job it might be hard to find the time to code.)\n\nWhen I learned to code those first two points were the biggest barriers to progress.

In fact, writing HTML is intensely boring, especially once you know what you're doing. (That's why I moved to Jade :smile:.)\n\n#### CSS\n\nCSS is a terrible language. It was designed for a very different web than we design for today. Styling text is usually simple enough, but when you want to get into any sort of layout styling things can get very frustrating very fast. Want to put something on the right? Just use `float: right;` and everything will be fine... until your containing div collapses and you have to figure out what \"clearfix\" means and how to implement it.

Inheritance is in quotes because, well, this is JS we're talking about. There is no real inheritance in the classical sense, but we can certainly make it work. The interview question went something like this:\n\n> Create a class Animal with a `walk` method. Then create a class Dog that inherits from Animal.\n\nSimple enough, right? Here's what I wrote:\n\n```js\nvar _ = require('lodash');\n\nfunction Animal() {}\n\nAnimal.prototype.walk = function() {\n  console.log(\"Hey there I'm an Animal walking\");\n};\n\nfunction Dog() {\n  Animal.call(this);\n}\n\n_.extend(Dog.prototype, Animal.prototype);\n```\n\nThis is certainly how I would have solved the inheritance problem in any of my projects, but as it turns out this isn't the best solution in the context of someone evaluating your JS prowess. Firstly, my solution explicitly depends on [Lo-Dash][lodash] (Underscore.js would also work just as well). These days it's hardly outlandish to assume that a given project would depend on either Lo-Dash or Underscore, so I don't see anything wrong with this but it still wasn't optimal in the given setting.\n\nThen there's the larger assumption my solution makes, which is that you're compiling your source through Browserify. Since I now use Browserify religiously on every project it didn't even occur to me to _mention_ this implicit dependency. If the interviewer wasn't familiar with Browserify himself he might have thought I was just crazy—requiring modules in a browser :confused:. Anyway, the answer they were going for was to use `Object.create` for defining the prototype of the subclass:\n\n```js\nfunction Animal() {}\n\nAnimal.prototype.walk = function() {\n  console.log(\"Hey there I'm an Animal walking\");\n};\n\nfunction Dog() {\n  Animal.call(this);\n}\n\nDog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);\nDog.prototype.constructor = Dog;\n```\n\nBoth solutions accomplish the same thing, but the latter can simply be pasted into a browser console while the former would have to be run through Browserify and have Lo-Dash installed through NPM.\n\n## Back to the basics\n\nWhat this brief experience made me realize is that there are still some basic JS methods that I'm not familiar with. Of course now it's unlikely that I will forget `Object.create`. This was a very healthy realization, because despite the fact that I am unlikely ever to use `Object.create` in any project of my own it's still good to know the ins and outs of the language you write your software in.\n\nSo, now that I'm quite familiar with `Object.create` I'm still going right back to my complex build process complete with browserify, stylus, jade and numerous Gulp tasks :smirk:. For anyone interested, my whole build process is implemented in a [Slush generator I use for new Node projects][generator]. The readme could use some work, but it should give you a gist of how I do my development.\n\n[generator]: https://github.com/iansinnott/slush-express-isinn\n\n[lodash]: https://lodash.com/\n","source":"_posts/2015-01-09-back-to-the-javascript-basics.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Back to the JavaScript Basics\n---\n\nToday I was interviewed for a developer position at a San Francisco startup and I was caught off guard when I was asked to create a simple implementation of \"inheritance\" in JS.

Anyway, the answer they were going for was to use <code>Object.create</code> for defining the prototype of the subclass:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">Animal</span>(<span class=\"params\"></span>) </span>&#123;&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Animal.prototype.walk = <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\"></span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"string\">\"Hey there I'm an Animal walking\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">Dog</span>(<span class=\"params\"></span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  Animal.call(<span class=\"keyword\">this</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Dog.prototype = <span class=\"built_in\">Object</span>.create(Animal.prototype);</div><div class=\"line\">Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Both solutions accomplish the same thing, but the latter can simply be pasted into a browser console while the former would have to be run through Browserify and have Lo-Dash installed through NPM.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Back-to-the-basics\"><a href=\"#Back-to-the-basics\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Back to the basics\"></a>Back to the basics</h2><p>What this brief experience made me realize is that there are still some basic JS methods that I’m not familiar with. Of course now it’s unlikely that I will forget <code>Object.create</code>. This was a very healthy realization, because despite the fact that I am unlikely ever to use <code>Object.create</code> in any project of my own it’s still good to know the ins and outs of the language you write your software in.</p>\n<p>So, now that I’m quite familiar with <code>Object.create</code> I’m still going right back to my complex build process complete with browserify, stylus, jade and numerous Gulp tasks :smirk:.

Intro (Simplifying Express)\n2. What is middleware?\n3. The relationship between Express and middleware\n  * Explanation (it's just a function)\n  * Build a simple logger\n4. Important points about middleware\n  * **MUST** call `next()`\n  * Order matters\n  * Middleware can be localized to various routes\n5. Routes are also middleware\n6. Handling errors\n  * 404\n  * Internal server error (500)\n7. Conclusion\n  * **Express is just a stack of middleware**\n  * Common and useful middleware you will undoubtedly see\n  * More resources\n\n## Simplifying Express\n\nSo first things first, rather than starting with everything and figuring out what it all does, let's start with a base Express configuration and add things as we need them.\n\nA standard Express app configuration using the `express-generator` NPM module will produce something like this:\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\nvar path = require('path');\nvar favicon = require('serve-favicon');\nvar logger = require('morgan');\nvar cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');\nvar bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n\nvar routes = require('./routes/index');\nvar users = require('./routes/users');\n\nvar app = express();\n\n// view engine setup\napp.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));\napp.set('view engine', 'jade');\n\n// uncomment after placing your favicon in /public\n//app.use(favicon(__dirname + '/public/favicon.ico'));\napp.use(logger('dev'));\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\napp.use(cookieParser());\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));\n\napp.use('/', routes);\napp.use('/users', users);\n\n// catch 404 and forward to error handler\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  var err = new Error('Not Found');\n  err.status = 404;\n  next(err);\n});\n\n// error handlers\nif (app.get('env') === 'development') {\n  app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {\n    res.status(err.status || 500);\n    res.render('error', {\n      message: err.message,\n      error: err\n    });\n  });\n}\n\napp.use(function(err, req, res, next) {\n  res.status(err.status || 500);\n  res.render('error', {\n    message: err.message,\n    error: {}\n  });\n});\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```\n\nThere's a lot going on there, and for anyone without experience using Express that may look daunting if all we really want is a super simple application.\n\n### Simplify all of the things!\n\nThe above configuration file also makes assumptions about what you will need in your project. This can be useful but it is quite detrimental to learning the ins and outs of Express, because it does too much automatically. Let's start from a bare-bones Express app and expand as needed. Here's our configuration file:\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"hello express\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\nThis file will responds to GET requests at `/`—the root URL. Any other requests will cause an Express error, because there is no request handler for any other route or method.\n\nIf you open your browser and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you should see the text \"hello express\", or you could use CURL:\n\n```\n$ curl :3000\nhello express\n```\n\nNow that we have a super simple Express app up and running, let's move on to middleware.\n\n## Middleware\n\nMiddleware, in the context of Express is just a fancy term for a function that gets run on your server _after_ a request has been received from a client and _before_ a response is sent back. In other words, it's a function that gets run **in the middle** of the requeset-response cycle.\n\nSo what does that look like in practice? Let's take a look:\n\n```js\n// Define your middleware\nfunction uselessMiddleware(req, res, next) {\n  // Do some stuff...\n  next();\n}\n\n// \"Use\" your middlware\napp.use(uselessMiddleware);\n```\n\nThe above function (middleware) is in fact useless as implied by its name because it doesn't do anything at all. It simply calls the next middleware in the middleware stack (more on that below).\n\nWhen writing simple middleware, we often use an anonymous function, so let's refactor the above as so:\n\n```js\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  // Do some stuff...\n  next();\n});\n```\n\nNow let's make our middleware do something.\n\n```js\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  console.log('hey nice middleware');\n  next();\n});\n```\n\nThis middleware is simply going to log a string to the console. To make sure it's working, and to see how middleware works, let's send a request to our server. Use either your browser or CURL from the command line:\n\n```\n$ curl :3000\nhello express\n```\n\nRegardless of how you made the requeset, if you now look in your terminal you should see that our middleware was indeed run because \"hey nice middleware\" will have been printed to the command line.\n\n## Express and Middleware\n\nThe one thing I want you to take away from this lecture is that **an Express app is simply a stack of middleware**. In other words, as the Express website says:\n\n> An Express application is essentially a series of middleware calls.\n\nTo see how true this is, let's look at a standard Express route:\n\n```js\napp.get('/hello', function(req, res) {\n  res.send('Hello route');\n});\n```\n\nThis is a super simple Express route that will respond to a GET request at `/hello` with the text string \"hello route\".\n\nBut what if we want some bit of code to be run on _all_ requests instead of just GET requests to `/hello`? For instance, what if we wanted to implement our own logger that would log the method and path of every request to the command line? That's where middleware comes in.\n\nWhen we call `app.use` we are saying, \"Every time a new request comes in run this function.\"\n\n### Building a simple logger\n\nTo see this in action let's built a simple logger that will output strings of the form:\n\n```\n[METHOD] [ROUTE] [DATE]\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```\nGET / Sun Jan 25 2015 22:27:07 GMT-0800 (PST)\nGET /some-route Sun Jan 25 2015 22:27:07 GMT-0800 (PST)\nPOST /contact Sun Jan 25 2015 22:27:07 GMT-0800 (PST)\n```\n\nUsing express middleware, we can accomplish this pretty easily:\n\n```js\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  var date = new Date();\n  console.log(req.method + ' ' + req.url + ' ' + date);\n  next();\n});\n```\n\nNow in just five lines of code we've created a rudimentary logging system.\n\n## Important points about middleware\n\nMiddleware is super flexible and easy to use, but there are still a few important points that need to be noted.\n\n### Always call `next`\n\nAs you've seen in all the middleware examples so far, I make sure to call `next` at the end of the function. What would happen if we didn't call next? Try it out. Remove next from our logging middleware above and run the app. Here's the full source code for `app.js`:\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\n\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  var date = new Date();\n  console.log(req.method + ' ' + req.url + ' ' + date);\n  // WE DIDN'T CALL `next` HERE!!\n});\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"hello express\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\nRun the app, then make a request:\n\n```\nnode app.js\n```\n\n```\ncurl :3000\n```\n\nNow your terminal will just sort of hang and do nothing. You will also see that the logging function was still run, because there will be a log entry in the terminal. This is because your app (`app.js`) received a request, called the logging middleware, logged the output and then... did nothing. The app is waiting for us to either send a response back to the client or call `next`. Since we didn't do either, it just hangs until we hit ctrl-c to stop our server.\n\nSo the point is, always call `next`, otherwise you're server will not only not respond but also not give you an error. It will simply do nothing, and leave the browser waiting for a response.\n\n### Order Matters\n\nAs the [documentation says][docs]:\n\n> Middleware functions are executed sequentially, therefore the order of middleware inclusion is important.\n\nThis is nothing overly complex, but it's important to be aware of. Here's a quick example, again using our logging middleware from above:\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\n\n// Route\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"hello express\");\n});\n\n// Logging middleware added after route\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  var date = new Date();\n  console.log(req.method + ' ' + req.url + ' ' + date);\n  next();\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\nAs before, run the app and send a request to the root URL at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The request that comes back from the server will have the text \"hello express\" as expected, but if you look at the console you will notice that our middleware did not run. This is because we added it _after_ our route.\n\n**What happened?**\n\nEven though we added the logging middleware _after_ the route, you might think it should still get run after our route is hit, but that's not the case. Calling `res.send` actually ends the request-response cycle, because it sends a response to the client. After the req-res cycle has ended, no more middleware will be called, so our logging middleware never gets executed.\n\n### Middleware can be localized to routes\n\nGlobal middleware is really useful, but sometimes it would be unecessary to run certain middleware for _all_ routes and methods. That's why Express let's you pass an optional string as the initial argument to `app.use`. Imagine we have an admin area on our website at `/admin`. We want to check to make sure a user is logged in before they access the page. A simple way to accomplish this would be:\n\n```js\napp.use('/admin', function(req, res, next) {\n  if (!req.user)\n    res.redirect('/login');\n  else\n    next();\n});\n```\n\nThis example assumes that `req.user` will be set if the user is already logged in, as is the case when using [Passport JS](http://passportjs.org/). If there is no user present on the request then the browser will be redirected to login. If there is a user however then the middleware simply calls next and allows the process to continue as normal.\n\n## Routes are just more middleware\n\nUsually when we talk about Express we talk about routes and middleware as separate, because conceptually they are. A \"route\" typically means the end of the middleware stack, the last response handler that is called and that decides ultimately how to respond to the request. However, to understand Express it's important to understand that routes themselves are also \"middleware\"—simply functions that get called under certain circumstances.\n\nAs an example, take a look at these two completely equivalent \"routes\". One is written as you would normally write a route, using `app.get` while the other is written as middleware, but the effect is exactly the same:\n\n```js\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send('hello express');\n});\n```\n\n```js\napp.use('/', function(req, res, next) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET')\n    res.send('hello express');\n  else\n    next();\n});\n```\n\nUsing middlware syntax and manually checking the request method is of course more verbose, and certainly not what you want to do in practice. But it's important to realize that Express routes and Express middleware ware actually on in the same. This is why, as mentioned in the docs and above...\n\n> An Express application is essentially a series of middleware calls.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nUntil you are comfortable with Express as a \"stack\" of middleware that get called in the order they were added, it may not be obvious how errors are normally handled. There is no `app.error` method. The way errors are handled is again, through middleware:\n\n```js\n// The rest of the app...\n\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  res.status(404).send(\"Oh no, there was an error...\");\n});\n```\n\nThis middleware matches any route and any method, and all it does is send an error message to the browser. If you added this at the top of all your middleware your site would continually send this error message to the client. However, by putting this at the very end of our app configuration we can allow all routes that weren't matched by previous middleware to effectively fall through and be caught here.\n\nHowever, since not every error is a 404, it's important to allow for other errors with other status codes. To accomplish this, Express recognizes middleware with four arguments instead of three as being an error handler.\n\n```js\napp.use(function(err, req, res, next) {\n  res.status(err.status || 500);\n  res.send(\"Oh no, there was an error...\");\n});\n```\n\nIn the eyes of Express, this middleware is clearly an error handler because it expects four arguments, the first of which is an error object. **Note:** If you don't manually set a status code 200 will still be the default, which would of course be incorrect for responding with an error. If there is no status set on the `err` object then we default to the generic 500 status code.\n\nSo, now we have an error handler but if you restart your server and navigate to a URL that we know there's no router for (ex: \"/something\") you will get a standard Express error, _NOT_ the custom error we just created. What happened?\n\nSince we aren't using any third party middleware yet, we know every piece of code that's being executed when a request hits the server. As a result, we can see that at no point is an error generated. This is crucial, because errors in Express are not automatic. JavaScript errors will happily bring down your server, but if you want to handle them with easy you will need to manually call the `next` function and pass an error argument. That will let Express execute our custom error handling code as scene above. So, to make sure all 404's do indeed generate an error, we can add a catch-all middleware right above our error handler:\n\n```js\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  var err = new Error(\"Page not found!\");\n  err.status = 404;\n  next(err); // Call `next` with an argument\n});\n\napp.use(function(err, req, res, next) {\n  res.status(err.status || 500);\n  res.send(\"Oh no, there was an error...\");\n});\n```\n\nNow if we restart our server we will get the result we want: All errors, 404 or otherwise, will be directed to our final error handler and we will get a response containing the string \"Oh no, there was an error...\".\n\n### A quick note on triggering errors\n\nIn the example above we called `next` with a single `Error` object as the lone argument. To generate an Express error and jump directly to error handling middleware you need only call `next` with a truthy argument. For example:\n\n```js\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n\n  // All of these would trigger error handling middleware\n  next('hey there');\n  next(40);\n  next(true);\n\n});\n```\n\nThe only exception to the above is calling `next('route')`. Calling `next` with the special string `'route'` will not cause an error. See [the docs here for more on this][nextdocs].\n\n[nextdocs]: http://expressjs.com/4x/api.html#app.METHOD\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo, once again to reiterate:\n\n> An Express application is essentially a series of middleware calls.\n\nIf you remember one thing from this lecture remember that, because it will give you a clear understanding of how Express works and more importantly how to extend it to suite your needs.\n\nThat being said, there is currently a plethora of useful middleware in the wild that you will most likely encounter at one point or another if you stick with Express.\n\n### Useful & Common Middleware\n\n**[Body Parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser)**\n\nThis is one you're almost certain to see in most Express apps, as it's useful for handling forms as well as AJAX requests.\n\n**[Serve Static](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser)**\n\nThis one makes it easy to statically serve a directory.

This can be useful but it is quite detrimental to learning the ins and outs of Express, because it does too much automatically. Let's start from a bare-bones Express app and expand as needed. Here's our configuration file:\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"hello express\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\nThis file will responds to GET requests at `/`—the root URL. Any other requests will cause an Express error, because there is no request handler for any other route or method.\n\nIf you open your browser and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you should see the text \"hello express\", or you could use CURL:\n\n```\n$ curl :3000\nhello express\n```\n\nNow that we have a super simple Express app up and running, let's move on to middleware.\n\n## Middleware\n\nMiddleware, in the context of Express is just a fancy term for a function that gets run on your server _after_ a request has been received from a client and _before_ a response is sent back. In other words, it's a function that gets run **in the middle** of the requeset-response cycle.\n\nSo what does that look like in practice? Let's take a look:\n\n```js\n// Define your middleware\nfunction uselessMiddleware(req, res, next) {\n  // Do some stuff...\n  next();\n}\n\n// \"Use\" your middlware\napp.use(uselessMiddleware);\n```\n\nThe above function (middleware) is in fact useless as implied by its name because it doesn't do anything at all. It simply calls the next middleware in the middleware stack (more on that below).\n\nWhen writing simple middleware, we often use an anonymous function, so let's refactor the above as so:\n\n```js\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  // Do some stuff...\n  next();\n});\n```\n\nNow let's make our middleware do something.\n\n```js\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  console.log('hey nice middleware');\n  next();\n});\n```\n\nThis middleware is simply going to log a string to the console. To make sure it's working, and to see how middleware works, let's send a request to our server. Use either your browser or CURL from the command line:\n\n```\n$ curl :3000\nhello express\n```\n\nRegardless of how you made the requeset, if you now look in your terminal you should see that our middleware was indeed run because \"hey nice middleware\" will have been printed to the command line.\n\n## Express and Middleware\n\nThe one thing I want you to take away from this lecture is that **an Express app is simply a stack of middleware**. In other words, as the Express website says:\n\n> An Express application is essentially a series of middleware calls.\n\nTo see how true this is, let's look at a standard Express route:\n\n```js\napp.get('/hello', function(req, res) {\n  res.send('Hello route');\n});\n```\n\nThis is a super simple Express route that will respond to a GET request at `/hello` with the text string \"hello route\".\n\nBut what if we want some bit of code to be run on _all_ requests instead of just GET requests to `/hello`? For instance, what if we wanted to implement our own logger that would log the method and path of every request to the command line? That's where middleware comes in.\n\nWhen we call `app.use` we are saying, \"Every time a new request comes in run this function.\"\n\n### Building a simple logger\n\nTo see this in action let's built a simple logger that will output strings of the form:\n\n```\n[METHOD] [ROUTE] [DATE]\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```\nGET / Sun Jan 25 2015 22:27:07 GMT-0800 (PST)\nGET /some-route Sun Jan 25 2015 22:27:07 GMT-0800 (PST)\nPOST /contact Sun Jan 25 2015 22:27:07 GMT-0800 (PST)\n```\n\nUsing express middleware, we can accomplish this pretty easily:\n\n```js\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  var date = new Date();\n  console.log(req.method + ' ' + req.url + ' ' + date);\n  next();\n});\n```\n\nNow in just five lines of code we've created a rudimentary logging system.\n\n## Important points about middleware\n\nMiddleware is super flexible and easy to use, but there are still a few important points that need to be noted.\n\n### Always call `next`\n\nAs you've seen in all the middleware examples so far, I make sure to call `next` at the end of the function. What would happen if we didn't call next? Try it out. Remove next from our logging middleware above and run the app. Here's the full source code for `app.js`:\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\n\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  var date = new Date();\n  console.log(req.method + ' ' + req.url + ' ' + date);\n  // WE DIDN'T CALL `next` HERE!!\n});\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"hello express\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\nRun the app, then make a request:\n\n```\nnode app.js\n```\n\n```\ncurl :3000\n```\n\nNow your terminal will just sort of hang and do nothing. You will also see that the logging function was still run, because there will be a log entry in the terminal. This is because your app (`app.js`) received a request, called the logging middleware, logged the output and then... did nothing. The app is waiting for us to either send a response back to the client or call `next`. Since we didn't do either, it just hangs until we hit ctrl-c to stop our server.\n\nSo the point is, always call `next`, otherwise you're server will not only not respond but also not give you an error. It will simply do nothing, and leave the browser waiting for a response.\n\n### Order Matters\n\nAs the [documentation says][docs]:\n\n> Middleware functions are executed sequentially, therefore the order of middleware inclusion is important.\n\nThis is nothing overly complex, but it's important to be aware of. Here's a quick example, again using our logging middleware from above:\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\n\n// Route\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"hello express\");\n});\n\n// Logging middleware added after route\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  var date = new Date();\n  console.log(req.method + ' ' + req.url + ' ' + date);\n  next();\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\nAs before, run the app and send a request to the root URL at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The request that comes back from the server will have the text \"hello express\" as expected, but if you look at the console you will notice that our middleware did not run. This is because we added it _after_ our route.\n\n**What happened?**\n\nEven though we added the logging middleware _after_ the route, you might think it should still get run after our route is hit, but that's not the case. Calling `res.send` actually ends the request-response cycle, because it sends a response to the client. After the req-res cycle has ended, no more middleware will be called, so our logging middleware never gets executed.\n\n### Middleware can be localized to routes\n\nGlobal middleware is really useful, but sometimes it would be unecessary to run certain middleware for _all_ routes and methods. That's why Express let's you pass an optional string as the initial argument to `app.use`. Imagine we have an admin area on our website at `/admin`. We want to check to make sure a user is logged in before they access the page. A simple way to accomplish this would be:\n\n```js\napp.use('/admin', function(req, res, next) {\n  if (!req.user)\n    res.redirect('/login');\n  else\n    next();\n});\n```\n\nThis example assumes that `req.user` will be set if the user is already logged in, as is the case when using [Passport JS](http://passportjs.org/). If there is no user present on the request then the browser will be redirected to login. If there is a user however then the middleware simply calls next and allows the process to continue as normal.\n\n## Routes are just more middleware\n\nUsually when we talk about Express we talk about routes and middleware as separate, because conceptually they are. A \"route\" typically means the end of the middleware stack, the last response handler that is called and that decides ultimately how to respond to the request. However, to understand Express it's important to understand that routes themselves are also \"middleware\"—simply functions that get called under certain circumstances.\n\nAs an example, take a look at these two completely equivalent \"routes\". One is written as you would normally write a route, using `app.get` while the other is written as middleware, but the effect is exactly the same:\n\n```js\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send('hello express');\n});\n```\n\n```js\napp.use('/', function(req, res, next) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET')\n    res.send('hello express');\n  else\n    next();\n});\n```\n\nUsing middlware syntax and manually checking the request method is of course more verbose, and certainly not what you want to do in practice. But it's important to realize that Express routes and Express middleware ware actually on in the same. This is why, as mentioned in the docs and above...\n\n> An Express application is essentially a series of middleware calls.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nUntil you are comfortable with Express as a \"stack\" of middleware that get called in the order they were added, it may not be obvious how errors are normally handled. There is no `app.error` method. The way errors are handled is again, through middleware:\n\n```js\n// The rest of the app...\n\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  res.status(404).send(\"Oh no, there was an error...\");\n});\n```\n\nThis middleware matches any route and any method, and all it does is send an error message to the browser. If you added this at the top of all your middleware your site would continually send this error message to the client. However, by putting this at the very end of our app configuration we can allow all routes that weren't matched by previous middleware to effectively fall through and be caught here.\n\nHowever, since not every error is a 404, it's important to allow for other errors with other status codes. To accomplish this, Express recognizes middleware with four arguments instead of three as being an error handler.\n\n```js\napp.use(function(err, req, res, next) {\n  res.status(err.status || 500);\n  res.send(\"Oh no, there was an error...\");\n});\n```\n\nIn the eyes of Express, this middleware is clearly an error handler because it expects four arguments, the first of which is an error object. **Note:** If you don't manually set a status code 200 will still be the default, which would of course be incorrect for responding with an error. If there is no status set on the `err` object then we default to the generic 500 status code.\n\nSo, now we have an error handler but if you restart your server and navigate to a URL that we know there's no router for (ex: \"/something\") you will get a standard Express error, _NOT_ the custom error we just created. What happened?\n\nSince we aren't using any third party middleware yet, we know every piece of code that's being executed when a request hits the server. As a result, we can see that at no point is an error generated. This is crucial, because errors in Express are not automatic. JavaScript errors will happily bring down your server, but if you want to handle them with easy you will need to manually call the `next` function and pass an error argument. That will let Express execute our custom error handling code as scene above. So, to make sure all 404's do indeed generate an error, we can add a catch-all middleware right above our error handler:\n\n```js\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  var err = new Error(\"Page not found!\");\n  err.status = 404;\n  next(err); // Call `next` with an argument\n});\n\napp.use(function(err, req, res, next) {\n  res.status(err.status || 500);\n  res.send(\"Oh no, there was an error...\");\n});\n```\n\nNow if we restart our server we will get the result we want: All errors, 404 or otherwise, will be directed to our final error handler and we will get a response containing the string \"Oh no, there was an error...\".\n\n### A quick note on triggering errors\n\nIn the example above we called `next` with a single `Error` object as the lone argument. To generate an Express error and jump directly to error handling middleware you need only call `next` with a truthy argument. For example:\n\n```js\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n\n  // All of these would trigger error handling middleware\n  next('hey there');\n  next(40);\n  next(true);\n\n});\n```\n\nThe only exception to the above is calling `next('route')`. Calling `next` with the special string `'route'` will not cause an error. See [the docs here for more on this][nextdocs].\n\n[nextdocs]: http://expressjs.com/4x/api.html#app.METHOD\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo, once again to reiterate:\n\n> An Express application is essentially a series of middleware calls.\n\nIf you remember one thing from this lecture remember that, because it will give you a clear understanding of how Express works and more importantly how to extend it to suite your needs.\n\nThat being said, there is currently a plethora of useful middleware in the wild that you will most likely encounter at one point or another if you stick with Express.\n\n### Useful & Common Middleware\n\n**[Body Parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser)**\n\nThis is one you're almost certain to see in most Express apps, as it's useful for handling forms as well as AJAX requests.\n\n**[Serve Static](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser)**\n\nThis one makes it easy to statically serve a directory. For example, if you have a `/public` and you would like to put all your static files there (images, css, scripts) then you would want to use the static middleware to field requests for all resources under public. This is so common that the serve-static middleware is actually bundled with Express:\n\n```js\napp.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public')));\n```\n\n**[Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)**\n\nThis is flexible logging software that can be used in development or production.

you will need in your project. This can be useful but it is quite detrimental to learning the ins and outs of Express, because it does too much automatically. Let’s start from a bare-bones Express app and expand as needed. Here’s our configuration file:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> express = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'express'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> app = express();</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.get(<span class=\"string\">'/'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">\"hello express\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.listen(<span class=\"number\">3000</span>);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This file will responds to GET requests at <code>/</code>—the root URL. Any other requests will cause an Express error, because there is no request handler for any other route or method.</p>\n<p>If you open your browser and go to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">localhost:3000</a> you should see the text “hello express”, or you could use CURL:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">$ curl :3000</div><div class=\"line\">hello express</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now that we have a super simple Express app up and running, let’s move on to middleware.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Middleware\"><a href=\"#Middleware\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Middleware\"></a>Middleware</h2><p>Middleware, in the context of Express is just a fancy term for a function that gets run on your server <em>after</em> a request has been received from a client and <em>before</em> a response is sent back. In other words, it’s a function that gets run <strong>in the middle</strong> of the requeset-response cycle.</p>\n<p>So what does that look like in practice? Let’s take a look:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// Define your middleware</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">uselessMiddleware</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"comment\">// Do some stuff...</span></div><div class=\"line\">  next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// \"Use\" your middlware</span></div><div class=\"line\">app.use(uselessMiddleware);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The above function (middleware) is in fact useless as implied by its name because it doesn’t do anything at all. It simply calls the next middleware in the middleware stack (more on that below).</p>\n<p>When writing simple middleware, we often use an anonymous function, so let’s refactor the above as so:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"comment\">// Do some stuff...</span></div><div class=\"line\">  next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now let’s make our middleware do something.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"string\">'hey nice middleware'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This middleware is simply going to log a string to the console. To make sure it’s working, and to see how middleware works, let’s send a request to our server. Use either your browser or CURL from the command line:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">$ curl :3000</div><div class=\"line\">hello express</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Regardless of how you made the requeset, if you now look in your terminal you should see that our middleware was indeed run because “hey nice middleware” will have been printed to the command line.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Express-and-Middleware\"><a href=\"#Express-and-Middleware\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Express and Middleware\"></a>Express and Middleware</h2><p>The one thing I want you to take away from this lecture is that <strong>an Express app is simply a stack of middleware</strong>. In other words, as the Express website says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An Express application is essentially a series of middleware calls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To see how true this is, let’s look at a standard Express route:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.get(<span class=\"string\">'/hello'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">'Hello route'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This is a super simple Express route that will respond to a GET request at <code>/hello</code> with the text string “hello route”.</p>\n<p>But what if we want some bit of code to be run on <em>all</em> requests instead of just GET requests to <code>/hello</code>? For instance, what if we wanted to implement our own logger that would log the method and path of every request to the command line? That’s where middleware comes in.</p>\n<p>When we call <code>app.use</code> we are saying, “Every time a new request comes in run this function.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"Building-a-simple-logger\"><a href=\"#Building-a-simple-logger\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Building a simple logger\"></a>Building a simple logger</h3><p>To see this in action let’s built a simple logger that will output strings of the form:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">[METHOD] [ROUTE] [DATE]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">GET / Sun Jan 25 2015 22:27:07 GMT-0800 (PST)</div><div class=\"line\">GET /some-route Sun Jan 25 2015 22:27:07 GMT-0800 (PST)</div><div class=\"line\">POST /contact Sun Jan 25 2015 22:27:07 GMT-0800 (PST)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Using express middleware, we can accomplish this pretty easily:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> date = <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"built_in\">Date</span>();</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"built_in\">console</span>.log(req.method + <span class=\"string\">' '</span> + req.url + <span class=\"string\">' '</span> + date);</div><div class=\"line\">  next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now in just five lines of code we’ve created a rudimentary logging system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Important-points-about-middleware\"><a href=\"#Important-points-about-middleware\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Important points about middleware\"></a>Important points about middleware</h2><p>Middleware is super flexible and easy to use, but there are still a few important points that need to be noted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Always-call-next\"><a href=\"#Always-call-next\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Always call next\"></a>Always call <code>next</code></h3><p>As you’ve seen in all the middleware examples so far, I make sure to call <code>next</code> at the end of the function. What would happen if we didn’t call next? Try it out. Remove next from our logging middleware above and run the app. Here’s the full source code for <code>app.js</code>:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> express = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'express'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> app = express();</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> date = <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"built_in\">Date</span>();</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"built_in\">console</span>.log(req.method + <span class=\"string\">' '</span> + req.url + <span class=\"string\">' '</span> + date);</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"comment\">// WE DIDN'T CALL `next` HERE!!</span></div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.get(<span class=\"string\">'/'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">\"hello express\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.listen(<span class=\"number\">3000</span>);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Run the app, then make a request:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">node app.js</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">curl :3000</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now your terminal will just sort of hang and do nothing. You will also see that the logging function was still run, because there will be a log entry in the terminal. This is because your app (<code>app.js</code>) received a request, called the logging middleware, logged the output and then… did nothing. The app is waiting for us to either send a response back to the client or call <code>next</code>. Since we didn’t do either, it just hangs until we hit ctrl-c to stop our server.</p>\n<p>So the point is, always call <code>next</code>, otherwise you’re server will not only not respond but also not give you an error. It will simply do nothing, and leave the browser waiting for a response.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Order-Matters\"><a href=\"#Order-Matters\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Order Matters\"></a>Order Matters</h3><p>As the <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">documentation says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Middleware functions are executed sequentially, therefore the order of middleware inclusion is important.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is nothing overly complex, but it’s important to be aware of. Here’s a quick example, again using our logging middleware from above:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div><div class=\"line\">16</div><div class=\"line\">17</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> express = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'express'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> app = express();</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// Route</span></div><div class=\"line\">app.get(<span class=\"string\">'/'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">\"hello express\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// Logging middleware added after route</span></div><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> date = <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"built_in\">Date</span>();</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"built_in\">console</span>.log(req.method + <span class=\"string\">' '</span> + req.url + <span class=\"string\">' '</span> + date);</div><div class=\"line\">  next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.listen(<span class=\"number\">3000</span>);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>As before, run the app and send a request to the root URL at <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">localhost:3000</a>. The request that comes back from the server will have the text “hello express” as expected, but if you look at the console you will notice that our middleware did not run. This is because we added it <em>after</em> our route.</p>\n<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>\n<p>Even though we added the logging middleware <em>after</em> the route, you might think it should still get run after our route is hit, but that’s not the case. Calling <code>res.send</code> actually ends the request-response cycle, because it sends a response to the client. After the req-res cycle has ended, no more middleware will be called, so our logging middleware never gets executed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Middleware-can-be-localized-to-routes\"><a href=\"#Middleware-can-be-localized-to-routes\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Middleware can be localized to routes\"></a>Middleware can be localized to routes</h3><p>Global middleware is really useful, but sometimes it would be unecessary to run certain middleware for <em>all</em> routes and methods. That’s why Express let’s you pass an optional string as the initial argument to <code>app.use</code>. Imagine we have an admin area on our website at <code>/admin</code>. We want to check to make sure a user is logged in before they access the page. A simple way to accomplish this would be:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"string\">'/admin'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (!req.user)</div><div class=\"line\">    res.redirect(<span class=\"string\">'/login'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">else</span></div><div class=\"line\">    next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This example assumes that <code>req.user</code> will be set if the user is already logged in, as is the case when using <a href=\"http://passportjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Passport JS</a>. If there is no user present on the request then the browser will be redirected to login. If there is a user however then the middleware simply calls next and allows the process to continue as normal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Routes-are-just-more-middleware\"><a href=\"#Routes-are-just-more-middleware\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Routes are just more middleware\"></a>Routes are just more middleware</h2><p>Usually when we talk about Express we talk about routes and middleware as separate, because conceptually they are. A “route” typically means the end of the middleware stack, the last response handler that is called and that decides ultimately how to respond to the request. However, to understand Express it’s important to understand that routes themselves are also “middleware”—simply functions that get called under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>As an example, take a look at these two completely equivalent “routes”. One is written as you would normally write a route, using <code>app.get</code> while the other is written as middleware, but the effect is exactly the same:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.get(<span class=\"string\">'/'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">'hello express'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"string\">'/'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (req.method === <span class=\"string\">'GET'</span>)</div><div class=\"line\">    res.send(<span class=\"string\">'hello express'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">else</span></div><div class=\"line\">    next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Using middlware syntax and manually checking the request method is of course more verbose, and certainly not what you want to do in practice. But it’s important to realize that Express routes and Express middleware ware actually on in the same. This is why, as mentioned in the docs and above…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An Express application is essentially a series of middleware calls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"Error-Handling\"><a href=\"#Error-Handling\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Error Handling\"></a>Error Handling</h2><p>Until you are comfortable with Express as a “stack” of middleware that get called in the order they were added, it may not be obvious how errors are normally handled. There is no <code>app.error</code> method. The way errors are handled is again, through middleware:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// The rest of the app...</span></div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.status(<span class=\"number\">404</span>).send(<span class=\"string\">\"Oh no, there was an error...\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This middleware matches any route and any method, and all it does is send an error message to the browser. If you added this at the top of all your middleware your site would continually send this error message to the client. However, by putting this at the very end of our app configuration we can allow all routes that weren’t matched by previous middleware to effectively fall through and be caught here.</p>\n<p>However, since not every error is a 404, it’s important to allow for other errors with other status codes. To accomplish this, Express recognizes middleware with four arguments instead of three as being an error handler.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">err, req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.status(err.status || <span class=\"number\">500</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">\"Oh no, there was an error...\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>In the eyes of Express, this middleware is clearly an error handler because it expects four arguments, the first of which is an error object. <strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t manually set a status code 200 will still be the default, which would of course be incorrect for responding with an error. If there is no status set on the <code>err</code> object then we default to the generic 500 status code.</p>\n<p>So, now we have an error handler but if you restart your server and navigate to a URL that we know there’s no router for (ex: “/something”) you will get a standard Express error, <em>NOT</em> the custom error we just created. What happened?</p>\n<p>Since we aren’t using any third party middleware yet, we know every piece of code that’s being executed when a request hits the server. As a result, we can see that at no point is an error generated. This is crucial, because errors in Express are not automatic. JavaScript errors will happily bring down your server, but if you want to handle them with easy you will need to manually call the <code>next</code> function and pass an error argument. That will let Express execute our custom error handling code as scene above. So, to make sure all 404’s do indeed generate an error, we can add a catch-all middleware right above our error handler:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> err = <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"built_in\">Error</span>(<span class=\"string\">\"Page not found!\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  err.status = <span class=\"number\">404</span>;</div><div class=\"line\">  next(err); <span class=\"comment\">// Call `next` with an argument</span></div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">err, req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.status(err.status || <span class=\"number\">500</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">\"Oh no, there was an error...\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now if we restart our server we will get the result we want: All errors, 404 or otherwise, will be directed to our final error handler and we will get a response containing the string “Oh no, there was an error…”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"A-quick-note-on-triggering-errors\"><a href=\"#A-quick-note-on-triggering-errors\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"A quick note on triggering errors\"></a>A quick note on triggering errors</h3><p>In the example above we called <code>next</code> with a single <code>Error</code> object as the lone argument. To generate an Express error and jump directly to error handling middleware you need only call <code>next</code> with a truthy argument. For example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"comment\">// All of these would trigger error handling middleware</span></div><div class=\"line\">  next(<span class=\"string\">'hey there'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  next(<span class=\"number\">40</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  next(<span class=\"literal\">true</span>);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The only exception to the above is calling <code>next(&#39;route&#39;)</code>. Calling <code>next</code> with the special string <code>&#39;route&#39;</code> will not cause an error.

there, and for anyone without experience using Express that may look daunting if all we really want is a super simple application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Simplify-all-of-the-things\"><a href=\"#Simplify-all-of-the-things\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Simplify all of the things!\"></a>Simplify all of the things!</h3><p>The above configuration file also makes assumptions about what you will need in your project. This can be useful but it is quite detrimental to learning the ins and outs of Express, because it does too much automatically. Let’s start from a bare-bones Express app and expand as needed. Here’s our configuration file:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> express = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'express'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> app = express();</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.get(<span class=\"string\">'/'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">\"hello express\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.listen(<span class=\"number\">3000</span>);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This file will responds to GET requests at <code>/</code>—the root URL. Any other requests will cause an Express error, because there is no request handler for any other route or method.</p>\n<p>If you open your browser and go to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">localhost:3000</a> you should see the text “hello express”, or you could use CURL:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">$ curl :3000</div><div class=\"line\">hello express</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now that we have a super simple Express app up and running, let’s move on to middleware.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Middleware\"><a href=\"#Middleware\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Middleware\"></a>Middleware</h2><p>Middleware, in the context of Express is just a fancy term for a function that gets run on your server <em>after</em> a request has been received from a client and <em>before</em> a response is sent back. In other words, it’s a function that gets run <strong>in the middle</strong> of the requeset-response cycle.</p>\n<p>So what does that look like in practice? Let’s take a look:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// Define your middleware</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">uselessMiddleware</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"comment\">// Do some stuff...</span></div><div class=\"line\">  next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// \"Use\" your middlware</span></div><div class=\"line\">app.use(uselessMiddleware);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The above function (middleware) is in fact useless as implied by its name because it doesn’t do anything at all. It simply calls the next middleware in the middleware stack (more on that below).</p>\n<p>When writing simple middleware, we often use an anonymous function, so let’s refactor the above as so:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"comment\">// Do some stuff...</span></div><div class=\"line\">  next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now let’s make our middleware do something.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"string\">'hey nice middleware'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This middleware is simply going to log a string to the console. To make sure it’s working, and to see how middleware works, let’s send a request to our server. Use either your browser or CURL from the command line:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">$ curl :3000</div><div class=\"line\">hello express</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Regardless of how you made the requeset, if you now look in your terminal you should see that our middleware was indeed run because “hey nice middleware” will have been printed to the command line.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Express-and-Middleware\"><a href=\"#Express-and-Middleware\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Express and Middleware\"></a>Express and Middleware</h2><p>The one thing I want you to take away from this lecture is that <strong>an Express app is simply a stack of middleware</strong>. In other words, as the Express website says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An Express application is essentially a series of middleware calls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To see how true this is, let’s look at a standard Express route:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.get(<span class=\"string\">'/hello'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">'Hello route'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This is a super simple Express route that will respond to a GET request at <code>/hello</code> with the text string “hello route”.</p>\n<p>But what if we want some bit of code to be run on <em>all</em> requests instead of just GET requests to <code>/hello</code>? For instance, what if we wanted to implement our own logger that would log the method and path of every request to the command line?

What would happen if we didn’t call next? Try it out. Remove next from our logging middleware above and run the app. Here’s the full source code for <code>app.js</code>:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> express = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'express'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> app = express();</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> date = <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"built_in\">Date</span>();</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"built_in\">console</span>.log(req.method + <span class=\"string\">' '</span> + req.url + <span class=\"string\">' '</span> + date);</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"comment\">// WE DIDN'T CALL `next` HERE!!</span></div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.get(<span class=\"string\">'/'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">\"hello express\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.listen(<span class=\"number\">3000</span>);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Run the app, then make a request:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">node app.js</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">curl :3000</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now your terminal will just sort of hang and do nothing. You will also see that the logging function was still run, because there will be a log entry in the terminal. This is because your app (<code>app.js</code>) received a request, called the logging middleware, logged the output and then… did nothing. The app is waiting for us to either send a response back to the client or call <code>next</code>. Since we didn’t do either, it just hangs until we hit ctrl-c to stop our server.</p>\n<p>So the point is, always call <code>next</code>, otherwise you’re server will not only not respond but also not give you an error. It will simply do nothing, and leave the browser waiting for a response.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Order-Matters\"><a href=\"#Order-Matters\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Order Matters\"></a>Order Matters</h3><p>As the <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware.html\">documentation says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Middleware functions are executed sequentially, therefore the order of middleware inclusion is important.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is nothing overly complex, but it’s important to be aware of. Here’s a quick example, again using our logging middleware from above:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div><div class=\"line\">16</div><div class=\"line\">17</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> express = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'express'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> app = express();</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// Route</span></div><div class=\"line\">app.get(<span class=\"string\">'/'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">\"hello express\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// Logging middleware added after route</span></div><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> date = <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"built_in\">Date</span>();</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"built_in\">console</span>.log(req.method + <span class=\"string\">' '</span> + req.url + <span class=\"string\">' '</span> + date);</div><div class=\"line\">  next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.listen(<span class=\"number\">3000</span>);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>As before, run the app and send a request to the root URL at <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">localhost:3000</a>. The request that comes back from the server will have the text “hello express” as expected, but if you look at the console you will notice that our middleware did not run. This is because we added it <em>after</em> our route.</p>\n<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>\n<p>Even though we added the logging middleware <em>after</em> the route, you might think it should still get run after our route is hit, but that’s not the case. Calling <code>res.send</code> actually ends the request-response cycle, because it sends a response to the client. After the req-res cycle has ended, no more middleware will be called, so our logging middleware never gets executed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Middleware-can-be-localized-to-routes\"><a href=\"#Middleware-can-be-localized-to-routes\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Middleware can be localized to routes\"></a>Middleware can be localized to routes</h3><p>Global middleware is really useful, but sometimes it would be unecessary to run certain middleware for <em>all</em> routes and methods. That’s why Express let’s you pass an optional string as the initial argument to <code>app.use</code>. Imagine we have an admin area on our website at <code>/admin</code>. We want to check to make sure a user is logged in before they access the page. A simple way to accomplish this would be:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"string\">'/admin'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (!req.user)</div><div class=\"line\">    res.redirect(<span class=\"string\">'/login'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">else</span></div><div class=\"line\">    next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This example assumes that <code>req.user</code> will be set if the user is already logged in, as is the case when using <a href=\"http://passportjs.org/\">Passport JS</a>. If there is no user present on the request then the browser will be redirected to login. If there is a user however then the middleware simply calls next and allows the process to continue as normal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Routes-are-just-more-middleware\"><a href=\"#Routes-are-just-more-middleware\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Routes are just more middleware\"></a>Routes are just more middleware</h2><p>Usually when we talk about Express we talk about routes and middleware as separate, because conceptually they are. A “route” typically means the end of the middleware stack, the last response handler that is called and that decides ultimately how to respond to the request. However, to understand Express it’s important to understand that routes themselves are also “middleware”—simply functions that get called under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>As an example, take a look at these two completely equivalent “routes”. One is written as you would normally write a route, using <code>app.get</code> while the other is written as middleware, but the effect is exactly the same:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.get(<span class=\"string\">'/'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">'hello express'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"string\">'/'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (req.method === <span class=\"string\">'GET'</span>)</div><div class=\"line\">    res.send(<span class=\"string\">'hello express'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">else</span></div><div class=\"line\">    next();</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Using middlware syntax and manually checking the request method is of course more verbose, and certainly not what you want to do in practice. But it’s important to realize that Express routes and Express middleware ware actually on in the same. This is why, as mentioned in the docs and above…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An Express application is essentially a series of middleware calls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"Error-Handling\"><a href=\"#Error-Handling\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Error Handling\"></a>Error Handling</h2><p>Until you are comfortable with Express as a “stack” of middleware that get called in the order they were added, it may not be obvious how errors are normally handled. There is no <code>app.error</code> method. The way errors are handled is again, through middleware:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// The rest of the app...</span></div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.status(<span class=\"number\">404</span>).send(<span class=\"string\">\"Oh no, there was an error...\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This middleware matches any route and any method, and all it does is send an error message to the browser. If you added this at the top of all your middleware your site would continually send this error message to the client. However, by putting this at the very end of our app configuration we can allow all routes that weren’t matched by previous middleware to effectively fall through and be caught here.</p>\n<p>However, since not every error is a 404, it’s important to allow for other errors with other status codes. To accomplish this, Express recognizes middleware with four arguments instead of three as being an error handler.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">err, req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.status(err.status || <span class=\"number\">500</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">\"Oh no, there was an error...\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>In the eyes of Express, this middleware is clearly an error handler because it expects four arguments, the first of which is an error object. <strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t manually set a status code 200 will still be the default, which would of course be incorrect for responding with an error. If there is no status set on the <code>err</code> object then we default to the generic 500 status code.</p>\n<p>So, now we have an error handler but if you restart your server and navigate to a URL that we know there’s no router for (ex: “/something”) you will get a standard Express error, <em>NOT</em> the custom error we just created. What happened?</p>\n<p>Since we aren’t using any third party middleware yet, we know every piece of code that’s being executed when a request hits the server. As a result, we can see that at no point is an error generated. This is crucial, because errors in Express are not automatic. JavaScript errors will happily bring down your server, but if you want to handle them with easy you will need to manually call the <code>next</code> function and pass an error argument. That will let Express execute our custom error handling code as scene above. So, to make sure all 404’s do indeed generate an error, we can add a catch-all middleware right above our error handler:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> err = <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"built_in\">Error</span>(<span class=\"string\">\"Page not found!\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  err.status = <span class=\"number\">404</span>;</div><div class=\"line\">  next(err); <span class=\"comment\">// Call `next` with an argument</span></div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">err, req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  res.status(err.status || <span class=\"number\">500</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  res.send(<span class=\"string\">\"Oh no, there was an error...\"</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now if we restart our server we will get the result we want: All errors, 404 or otherwise, will be directed to our final error handler and we will get a response containing the string “Oh no, there was an error…”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"A-quick-note-on-triggering-errors\"><a href=\"#A-quick-note-on-triggering-errors\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"A quick note on triggering errors\"></a>A quick note on triggering errors</h3><p>In the example above we called <code>next</code> with a single <code>Error</code> object as the lone argument. To generate an Express error and jump directly to error handling middleware you need only call <code>next</code> with a truthy argument. For example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"comment\">// All of these would trigger error handling middleware</span></div><div class=\"line\">  next(<span class=\"string\">'hey there'</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  next(<span class=\"number\">40</span>);</div><div class=\"line\">  next(<span class=\"literal\">true</span>);</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The only exception to the above is calling <code>next(&#39;route&#39;)</code>. Calling <code>next</code> with the special string <code>&#39;route&#39;</code> will not cause an error. See <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/4x/api.html#app.METHOD\">the docs here for more on this</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, once again to reiterate:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An Express application is essentially a series of middleware calls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you remember one thing from this lecture remember that, because it will give you a clear understanding of how Express works and more importantly how to extend it to suite your needs.</p>\n<p>That being said, there is currently a plethora of useful middleware in the wild that you will most likely encounter at one point or another if you stick with Express.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Useful-amp-Common-Middleware\"><a href=\"#Useful-amp-Common-Middleware\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Useful &amp; Common Middleware\"></a>Useful &amp; Common Middleware</h3><p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser\">Body Parser</a></strong></p>\n<p>This is one you’re almost certain to see in most Express apps, as it’s useful for handling forms as well as AJAX requests.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser\">Serve Static</a></strong></p>\n<p>This one makes it easy to statically serve a directory. For example, if you have a <code>/public</code> and you would like to put all your static files there (images, css, scripts) then you would want to use the static middleware to field requests for all resources under public. This is so common that the serve-static middleware is actually bundled with Express:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">app.use(express.static(__dirname + <span class=\"string\">'/public'</span>)));</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/expressjs/morgan\">Morgan</a></strong></p>\n<p>This is flexible logging software that can be used in development or production.

It's not uncommon during an initial phone screen to be asked some variation of the following “soft” interview question:\n\n> What are you passionate about?\n\nor...\n\n> Why do you like software development?\n\nAs simple and possibly over-used as these questions are, they're still good ones. So am I _really_ passionate about software development? Hell yes. But that's not the answer to the underlying question of why—why am I passionate about it?\n\nIt's this line of thinking that has led me to do some introspection recently, and I've come to the conclusion that what it really boils down to is **solving problems**.\n\n## Solving problems is the biggest win\n\nWhen you solve a problem for yourself it feels great. Not only that, but you then have one less problem. The satisfaction of solving problems certainly isn't exclusive to programming, but programming is one of the best tools to solve an extremely wide array of problems, which is why I love it.\n\nBut as satisfying as solving one's own problems can be, the biggest win in my mind is to ...\n\n## Solve other people's problems\n\nThis realization really solidified in my mind a number of months ago as I was combing through [my GitHub profile][gh] to clean out old repositories I no longer use.

It's that motivation that has kept that little project going. That motivation is really powerful.\n\nIn this way solving someone's problem can become a positive feedback loop: The more positive feedback you get about your project and the way it's solving problems, the more you're motivated to continue to solve that problem.\n\nIt's a beautiful thing.\n\n[gh]: https://github.com/iansinnott\n[am]: https://github.com/iansinnott/alfred-maestro\n","source":"_posts/2015-02-20-solving-a-problem-is-the-biggest-win.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Solving problems is the biggest win\n---\n\nAs I ramp up my job search, I've recently become more introspective about why I like programming.

I'm about to start a greenfield project next week and I figure I might as well do it right. The goal is not to look back in two months and wish I had implemented a better workflow. The tooling can always change, but in practice it usually doesn't so it's best to get it right the first time.\n\nIn short, here's what I've decided on:\n\n* [Webpack][webpack] w/ [Hot Module Replacement][hmr] enabled\n* [Babel][babel] (ES6 compilation)\n* [Gulp][gulp]\n* [Stylus][stylus]\n\n## Webpack\n\nWebpack is amazing. I never thought [Browserify][browserify] would be replaced in my workflow, but it has been. Webpack essentially does everything Browserify did and more. It let's you require _anything_, including images, Markdown files, fonts and probably anything else you would need in a website.\n\n### So what?\n\nWebpack let's you truly componentize your applications by letting you keep _everything_ organized in a single directory. For example, if you wanted to componentize your website's header you could put the HTML, CSS, JS and all associated images in the same directory. No more fumbling with paths in you're image `src` attribute.\n\n### Hot Module Replacement\n\nRequiring everything is great, but another revelation was Hot Module Replacement (HRM). The concept is pretty simple if you've ever used LiveReload—Your browser refreshes every time you change a file. Webpack gives you HMR, which takes the concept of live reload to the next level. Basically the HTML in your browser will change without reloading the browser window.\n\n**This is a _huge_ win.**\n\nWhen you're developing any sort of stateful UI you generally have to make changes, reload the browser and then click around to put the UI back in whatever state you were at before. The classic example is a dropdown menu, that would be hidden whenever you reload the browser.\n\nWith HMR you don't have to reload anything. You simply change your HTML/CSS and the changes will be reflected live in the browser without having to do a full page reload. **So good!**\n\n## Babel\n\nBabel is a pre-compiler for ES6, which means you can write JavaScript using full ES6 features and functionality. Babel will compile everything down to standard ES5 JavaScript so that you can run it in any browser.\n\nIf you're using CoffeScript all the new ES6 features probably aren't that exciting, but the new spec is a big jump for JS as a language.\n\n## Gulp\n\nWebpack handles _almost_ every step of our build process, but sometimes you need to run arbitrary scripts or automate things at a higher level than webpack might allow. Gulp is great for this.\n\nIn my workflow I use gulp to script webpack and run an API server that the UI will interact with.\n\nGulp is also good for setting up a database process running in the background if you're app is using a persistence layer.\n\n## Stylus\n\nStylus is great. It's the most compact CSS syntax I've come across and it's written entirely in Node. This is probably one of the more contentious points in my build process since everyone seems to have very strong opinions about how to write their styles. But I think anyone who gave Stylus a try would really like it. Just remove all brackets, colons and semicolons from any CSS file and you're looking at beautiful Stylus syntax.\n\n## Conclusion: Increased productivity\n\nThis new workflow has really made me more productive. Writing single page apps now takes a fraction of the time it used to take. This is admittedly due in large part to [React][react] being an excellent library for productivity, but whatever.

I heavily advocate the use of both of these APIs in this article. If you want to see my thoughts on the deprecation see [this comment below](#comment-2692300179). For the official deprecation see [the docs article here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/two-way-binding-helpers.html).\n\n---\n\nWith React, you basically get two different ways to deal with forms:\n\n* Standard input elements that can be modified by the user\n* \"Controlled\" input elements that can only be modified programatically\n\nThe first type is pretty straightforward in React, you simply don't provide a `value` prop:\n\n```js\nReact.createClass({\n  render (\n    <input type='text' />\n  );\n});\n```\n\nThe value of that `<input>` element can be edited by the user in a browser, just like one would expect in a normal we app.\n\nThe other type of input—a \"Controlled\" input—looks almost the same, but has a `value` property:\n\n```js\nReact.createClass({\n  render (\n    <input type='text' value=\"You can't change me!\" />\n  );\n});\n```\n\nThe value of this `<input>` element will stubbornly refuse to change no matter what the user does. This is generally a terrible user experience, so React will actually warn you that your input cannot be modified:\n\n![React warning message](https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202015-05-11%20at%2011.12.36%20PM.png)\n\nIf you're new-ish to React you might not know why you would want to do this. The answer is _state_. React puts a big emphasis on explicitly keeping your components state in the `state` property. So in order to create a form input that responds to user input you will need to use two-way data binding. Meaning the `value` of the `<input>` element will flow from your component into the DOM, but also from the DOM into your component. In other words, they will be kept in sync.\n\n## Manual Two-way data binding\n\nThe most common way to accomplish two-way data binding in React is to be explicit. This is by design, and it's a good practice for smaller forms. Here's how an example:\n\n```js\nReact.createClass({\n  getInitialState() {\n    inputValue: ''\n  },\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <input\n        type='text'\n        value={this.state.inputValue}\n        onChange={this.onChange} />\n    );\n  },\n\n  onChange(e) {\n    this.setState({ inputValue: e.target.value });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nHere we've bound our input's change event to the component's `onChange` function which will update `this.state`. Whenever `this.state` is updated the component will be re-rendered, causing the input value to reflect what the user typed.\n\nIf that's not quite clear, I highly recommend taking a look at the [Forms guide on the React website][forms].\n\n[forms]: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html\n\nThe code above is explicit and not overly complicated, which is great for maintainabillty. There are virtually no downsides to this approach when dealing with a small form that only contains a few inputs. Issues only begin to crop up when you have many inputs that all need to update state.\n\nThat's why we have...\n\n## The LinkedStateMixin\n\nReact comes with a handy mixin to help you achieve two-way data-binding very quickly. Use the LinkedStateMixin to save yourself soem hassle when wiring up large forms to stay in sync with component state:\n\n```js\n// Make sure to require react with addons\nvar React = require('react/addons');\n\nReact.createClass({\n  mixins: [React.addons.LinkedStateMixin],\n\n  getInitialState() {\n    inputValue: ''\n  },\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <input type='text' valueLink={this.linkState('inputValue')} />\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAs you can see we replaced the `value` prop with `valueLink`. If you haven't heard of `valueLink` I'll explain it in a sec.\n\nThe `LinkedStateMixin` saves us a good deal of typing, and especially when you have a large number of form fields that need to be tied to component state. The issue is that it's not very flexible. Essentially it just binds the value of an input field to `this.state`. But what if you are building a _stateless_ form component that gets all it's values from props? Or, more interestingly, what if you are using Flux and don't want to set state directly but rather call an action that updates a store?\n\nThis is what `valueLink` is great for.\n\n## What exactly is `valueLink`?\n\nThe `valueLink` prop is a fairly under-documented feature of form inputs in React that simplifies the onChange / setState pattern described at the beginning of this post. It's a shortcut for telling an input where to get its `value` prop from and what function to call when an `onChange` event is fired. In it's most simple form the `valueLink` prop points to a plain old JS object with two distinct props:\n\n* `value`: The value of the input at any given time\n* `requestChange`: The function to call whenever `onChange` is fired on the input. `requestChange` will be called with the update value of the input, so there's no need to access the value using an event object as you might do if you were using the actual `onChange` event.\n\nIf you're familiar with React's PropTypes feature then this expression of `valueLink` as a `propType` should make it clear what you're going for:\n\n```js\nReact.createClass({\n  propTypes: {\n    valueLink: React.PropTypes.shape({\n      value: React.PropTypes.any.isRequired,\n      requestChange: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired\n    })\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Manually linking input value to state with `valueLink`\n\nLet's check out an example.\n\n```js\nfunction makeValueLink(key) {\n  return {\n    value: this.state[key],\n    requestChange: function(newValue) {\n      newState = {};\n      newState[key] = newValue;\n      this.setState(newState);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nReact.createClass({\n  getInitialState() {\n    inputValue: ''\n  },\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <input type='text' valueLink={makeValueLink('inputValue')} />\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nNow you will get the same two-way data binding as you did when using the `LinkedStateMixin`. What we've done here is basically created our own version of the `LinkedStateMixin` to demonstrate how `valueLink` works.\n\nYou can use `valueLink` to bind the `value` prop of any input to the state of a component. If you instead want to set state on a parent component you can pass a `valueLink` down as a prop just like you would do with an `onChange` callback.\n\n#### Don't forget about `checkedLink`\n\nThe other important point to note is that some input types, namely `<input type='radio'>` and `<input type='checkbox'>` use the `checked` prop because they represent boolean values. They still use a `value` prop to determine what value corresponds to the `checked` prop, but it's only the `checked` prop that can be changed by the user.\n\nReact acknowledges this and provides us with the `checkedLink` prop, which works exactly like `valueLink` except it binds the `checked` prop to state instead of the `value` prop.\n\n```js\nfunction makeValueLink(key) {\n  return {\n    value: this.state[key],\n    requestChange: function(newValue) {\n      newState = {};\n      newState[key] = newValue;\n      this.setState(newState);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nReact.createClass({\n  getInitialState() {\n    booleanValue: ''\n  },\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <input type='checkbox' checkedLink={makeValueLink('booleanValue')} />\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nNote that when using `checkedLink` the shape of the object you pass in is still exactly the same, i.e. it needs a `value` prop and a `requestChange` prop. This is good because it means we can use our `makeValueLink` function to bind any type of input to state including checkboxes and radios.\n\n## Putting it all together—Building a Flux form\n\nThe importance of `valueLink` really shines when you're using something like Flux where you don't actually want to update `this.state` directly but would like instead for data to flow through actions to stores which control the UI state. Using `valueLink` makes this is quite easy:\n\n```js\nvar AppActions = require('./AppActions');\n\nfunction makeValueLink(key) {\n  return {\n    value: this.state[key],\n    requestChange: function(newValue) {\n      AppActions.doSomething(key, newValue);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * This code is written much like you would if you were using the Alt Flux\n * implementation. The syntax would likely be slightly different with other\n * libraries.\n */\nReact.createClass({\n\n  // Assuming our store (AppStore) has a getState method, we would get the\n  // initial state like so\n  getInitialState() {\n    return AppStore.getState();\n  },\n\n  // Listen to our store for changes\n  componentDidMount() {\n    AppStore.listen(this.onChange);\n  },\n\n  // Stop listening if this component is unmounted\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    AppStore.unlisten(this.onChange);\n  },\n\n  // Whenever our store emits a change event, update `this.state` to reflect\n  // the state of the store.\n  onChange() {\n    this.setState(AppStore.getState());\n  },\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <input type='checkbox' checkedLink={makeValueLink('booleanValue')} />\n    );\n  }\n})\n```\n\nNow whenever you check the checkbox `AppActions.doSomething` will be called with a `key` of `'booleanValue'` and a `newValue` of either `true` or `false` depending on whether or not it is checked.\n\nThen in `AppActions` you would do whatever you want with the data and most likely dispatch it to all stores so they could update their state accordingly. `AppStore` would get the dispatch and update it's internal representation of state\n\nHope all this helps as you build forms with React.\n","source":"_posts/2015-05-11-managing-state-and-controlled-form-fields-with-react.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Managing state and controlled form fields with React\n---\n\n**UPDATE (2016-07-28):** As of React v15 `valueLink` and `checkedLink` are officially deprecated.

If you haven’t heard of <code>valueLink</code> I’ll explain it in a sec.</p>\n<p>The <code>LinkedStateMixin</code> saves us a good deal of typing, and especially when you have a large number of form fields that need to be tied to component state. The issue is that it’s not very flexible. Essentially it just binds the value of an input field to <code>this.state</code>. But what if you are building a <em>stateless</em> form component that gets all it’s values from props? Or, more interestingly, what if you are using Flux and don’t want to set state directly but rather call an action that updates a store?</p>\n<p>This is what <code>valueLink</code> is great for.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-exactly-is-valueLink\"><a href=\"#What-exactly-is-valueLink\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What exactly is valueLink?\"></a>What exactly is <code>valueLink</code>?</h2><p>The <code>valueLink</code> prop is a fairly under-documented feature of form inputs in React that simplifies the onChange / setState pattern described at the beginning of this post. It’s a shortcut for telling an input where to get its <code>value</code> prop from and what function to call when an <code>onChange</code> event is fired. In it’s most simple form the <code>valueLink</code> prop points to a plain old JS object with two distinct props:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>value</code>: The value of the input at any given time</li>\n<li><code>requestChange</code>: The function to call whenever <code>onChange</code> is fired on the input. <code>requestChange</code> will be called with the update value of the input, so there’s no need to access the value using an event object as you might do if you were using the actual <code>onChange</code> event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re familiar with React’s PropTypes feature then this expression of <code>valueLink</code> as a <code>propType</code> should make it clear what you’re going for:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">React.createClass(&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"attr\">propTypes</span>: &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">valueLink</span>: React.PropTypes.shape(&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">      <span class=\"attr\">value</span>: React.PropTypes.any.isRequired,</div><div class=\"line\">      <span class=\"attr\">requestChange</span>: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired</div><div class=\"line\">    &#125;)</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"Manually-linking-input-value-to-state-with-valueLink\"><a href=\"#Manually-linking-input-value-to-state-with-valueLink\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Manually linking input value to state with valueLink\"></a>Manually linking input value to state with <code>valueLink</code></h2><p>Let’s check out an example.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div><div class=\"line\">16</div><div class=\"line\">17</div><div class=\"line\">18</div><div class=\"line\">19</div><div class=\"line\">20</div><div class=\"line\">21</div><div class=\"line\">22</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">makeValueLink</span>(<span class=\"params\">key</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">value</span>: <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.state[key],</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">requestChange</span>: <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">newValue</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">      newState = &#123;&#125;;</div><div class=\"line\">      newState[key] = newValue;</div><div class=\"line\">      <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.setState(newState);</div><div class=\"line\">    &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">React.createClass(&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  getInitialState() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">inputValue</span>: <span class=\"string\">''</span></div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;,</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">  render() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> (</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;input type='text' valueLink=&#123;makeValueLink('inputValue')&#125; /&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    );</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now you will get the same two-way data binding as you did when using the <code>LinkedStateMixin</code>. What we’ve done here is basically created our own version of the <code>LinkedStateMixin</code> to demonstrate how <code>valueLink</code> works.</p>\n<p>You can use <code>valueLink</code> to bind the <code>value</code> prop of any input to the state of a component. If you instead want to set state on a parent component you can pass a <code>valueLink</code> down as a prop just like you would do with an <code>onChange</code> callback.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Don’t-forget-about-checkedLink\"><a href=\"#Don’t-forget-about-checkedLink\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Don’t forget about checkedLink\"></a>Don’t forget about <code>checkedLink</code></h4><p>The other important point to note is that some input types, namely <code>&lt;input type=&#39;radio&#39;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input type=&#39;checkbox&#39;&gt;</code> use the <code>checked</code> prop because they represent boolean values. They still use a <code>value</code> prop to determine what value corresponds to the <code>checked</code> prop, but it’s only the <code>checked</code> prop that can be changed by the user.</p>\n<p>React acknowledges this and provides us with the <code>checkedLink</code> prop, which works exactly like <code>valueLink</code> except it binds the <code>checked</code> prop to state instead of the <code>value</code> prop.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div><div class=\"line\">16</div><div class=\"line\">17</div><div class=\"line\">18</div><div class=\"line\">19</div><div class=\"line\">20</div><div class=\"line\">21</div><div class=\"line\">22</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">makeValueLink</span>(<span class=\"params\">key</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">value</span>: <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.state[key],</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">requestChange</span>: <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">newValue</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">      newState = &#123;&#125;;</div><div class=\"line\">      newState[key] = newValue;</div><div class=\"line\">      <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.setState(newState);</div><div class=\"line\">    &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">React.createClass(&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  getInitialState() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">booleanValue</span>: <span class=\"string\">''</span></div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;,</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">  render() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> (</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;input type='checkbox' checkedLink=&#123;makeValueLink('booleanValue')&#125; /&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    );</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Note that when using <code>checkedLink</code> the shape of the object you pass in is still exactly the same, i.e. it needs a <code>value</code> prop and a <code>requestChange</code> prop.

The answer is <em>state</em>. React puts a big emphasis on explicitly keeping your components state in the <code>state</code> property. So in order to create a form input that responds to user input you will need to use two-way data binding. Meaning the <code>value</code> of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element will flow from your component into the DOM, but also from the DOM into your component. In other words, they will be kept in sync.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Manual-Two-way-data-binding\"><a href=\"#Manual-Two-way-data-binding\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Manual Two-way data binding\"></a>Manual Two-way data binding</h2><p>The most common way to accomplish two-way data binding in React is to be explicit.

If you haven’t heard of <code>valueLink</code> I’ll explain it in a sec.</p>\n<p>The <code>LinkedStateMixin</code> saves us a good deal of typing, and especially when you have a large number of form fields that need to be tied to component state. The issue is that it’s not very flexible. Essentially it just binds the value of an input field to <code>this.state</code>. But what if you are building a <em>stateless</em> form component that gets all it’s values from props? Or, more interestingly, what if you are using Flux and don’t want to set state directly but rather call an action that updates a store?</p>\n<p>This is what <code>valueLink</code> is great for.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-exactly-is-valueLink\"><a href=\"#What-exactly-is-valueLink\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What exactly is valueLink?\"></a>What exactly is <code>valueLink</code>?</h2><p>The <code>valueLink</code> prop is a fairly under-documented feature of form inputs in React that simplifies the onChange / setState pattern described at the beginning of this post. It’s a shortcut for telling an input where to get its <code>value</code> prop from and what function to call when an <code>onChange</code> event is fired. In it’s most simple form the <code>valueLink</code> prop points to a plain old JS object with two distinct props:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>value</code>: The value of the input at any given time</li>\n<li><code>requestChange</code>: The function to call whenever <code>onChange</code> is fired on the input. <code>requestChange</code> will be called with the update value of the input, so there’s no need to access the value using an event object as you might do if you were using the actual <code>onChange</code> event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re familiar with React’s PropTypes feature then this expression of <code>valueLink</code> as a <code>propType</code> should make it clear what you’re going for:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">React.createClass(&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"attr\">propTypes</span>: &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">valueLink</span>: React.PropTypes.shape(&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">      <span class=\"attr\">value</span>: React.PropTypes.any.isRequired,</div><div class=\"line\">      <span class=\"attr\">requestChange</span>: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired</div><div class=\"line\">    &#125;)</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"Manually-linking-input-value-to-state-with-valueLink\"><a href=\"#Manually-linking-input-value-to-state-with-valueLink\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Manually linking input value to state with valueLink\"></a>Manually linking input value to state with <code>valueLink</code></h2><p>Let’s check out an example.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div><div class=\"line\">16</div><div class=\"line\">17</div><div class=\"line\">18</div><div class=\"line\">19</div><div class=\"line\">20</div><div class=\"line\">21</div><div class=\"line\">22</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">makeValueLink</span>(<span class=\"params\">key</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">value</span>: <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.state[key],</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">requestChange</span>: <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">newValue</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">      newState = &#123;&#125;;</div><div class=\"line\">      newState[key] = newValue;</div><div class=\"line\">      <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.setState(newState);</div><div class=\"line\">    &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">React.createClass(&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  getInitialState() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">inputValue</span>: <span class=\"string\">''</span></div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;,</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">  render() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> (</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;input type='text' valueLink=&#123;makeValueLink('inputValue')&#125; /&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    );</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now you will get the same two-way data binding as you did when using the <code>LinkedStateMixin</code>. What we’ve done here is basically created our own version of the <code>LinkedStateMixin</code> to demonstrate how <code>valueLink</code> works.</p>\n<p>You can use <code>valueLink</code> to bind the <code>value</code> prop of any input to the state of a component. If you instead want to set state on a parent component you can pass a <code>valueLink</code> down as a prop just like you would do with an <code>onChange</code> callback.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Don’t-forget-about-checkedLink\"><a href=\"#Don’t-forget-about-checkedLink\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Don’t forget about checkedLink\"></a>Don’t forget about <code>checkedLink</code></h4><p>The other important point to note is that some input types, namely <code>&lt;input type=&#39;radio&#39;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input type=&#39;checkbox&#39;&gt;</code> use the <code>checked</code> prop because they represent boolean values. They still use a <code>value</code> prop to determine what value corresponds to the <code>checked</code> prop, but it’s only the <code>checked</code> prop that can be changed by the user.</p>\n<p>React acknowledges this and provides us with the <code>checkedLink</code> prop, which works exactly like <code>valueLink</code> except it binds the <code>checked</code> prop to state instead of the <code>value</code> prop.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div><div class=\"line\">16</div><div class=\"line\">17</div><div class=\"line\">18</div><div class=\"line\">19</div><div class=\"line\">20</div><div class=\"line\">21</div><div class=\"line\">22</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">makeValueLink</span>(<span class=\"params\">key</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">value</span>: <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.state[key],</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">requestChange</span>: <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">newValue</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">      newState = &#123;&#125;;</div><div class=\"line\">      newState[key] = newValue;</div><div class=\"line\">      <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.setState(newState);</div><div class=\"line\">    &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">React.createClass(&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  getInitialState() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">booleanValue</span>: <span class=\"string\">''</span></div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;,</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">  render() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> (</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;input type='checkbox' checkedLink=&#123;makeValueLink('booleanValue')&#125; /&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    );</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Note that when using <code>checkedLink</code> the shape of the object you pass in is still exactly the same, i.e. it needs a <code>value</code> prop and a <code>requestChange</code> prop.

With just _one line_ of code you can bypass the annoyance of not being able to access private web services (i.e. GitHub) while SSHed into a machine.

For every `Host` in your `~/.ssh/config` file you can add a new line that allows you to use your own _local_ SSH keys even while SSHed into the remote server. Example:\n\n```\nHost myhost\n  HostName X.X.X.X\n  ForwardAgent yes # <-- This line is key\n```\n\nSee that last line? That is all it takes to turn on agent forwarding whenever you SSH into the server called `myhost`. Cool right?\n\n### The workflow\n\nSo, you might be wondering why this matters. The answer is ease of deployment. For small and even mid-size projects it's probably not too much to ask to SSH in to the actual server whenever you need to deploy new code. This may not be the best or easiest deployment workflow, but it not difficult and it's quite simple.\n\nFurthermore, if your deployment process ever breaks it will not be difficult to troubleshoot because you will understand every step as opposed to using some automated deployment method that makes everything ten times as complex.\n\nNow that you have ForwardAgent turned on, you can do something like this:\n\n1. Change the codebase. Commit changes\n2. `git push`\n3. `ssh` into production server. `cd` into app directory\n4. `git pull`\n5. Restart your app, now with up-to-date code\n\nI love this workflow, mainly because step 4 is much easier than it was before I discovered `ForwardAgent`. Since you can easily pull code from any private repo that you have SSH access to you can now use Git as your primary means of deployment.\n\nStep 5 will depend on your setup and is up to you, but hopefully it's nothing too onerous.

That means all new projects I created were running Mongo, and Mongoose was my ORM of choice. Mongoose has worked well for my in the past and even _still_ does, but I can feel that it's time for a switch.\n\n## Why the change?\n\n### Mongo\n\nThe main reason actually isn't Mongoose, but rather **Mongo**. The data in _most_ applications is probably going to be relational so why would you use a non-relational database? The main reason I liked Mongo initially was that it had a JavaScript API but I've come to realize that doesn't matter that much, and it can even be a hindrance when working with team members that know and love SQL.\n\n### Mpromise\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know already, Mongoose provides a promise-based API for doing async database operations in addition to the classic callbacks.

This guy! :raised_hands:\n\n![Ian Speaking at Real World React Meetup](https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/rwr-ian-1.jpg \"Ian Speaking at Real World React Meetup\")\n\nLast Sunday was a significant event for me: I put on a [React][] workshop ([link here][workshop]) to teach beginners how to get started with React. It was a full day event and it was a great learning experience for myself and hopefully for the students as well.\n\n## Giving back to the community\n\nThe community surrounding React has done a lot for me. It's only been a year since I started using this technology, but it's played a tremendous role in my personal development as a programmer. As such, I really wanted to start contributing back to this amazing community that has helped nurture my own development.\n\nI learned React and the surrounding ecosystem on my own and I know how daunting it can be. As a community we love to toss around terms like ES6, Babel, Webpack, Flux, Redux, etc. as if it's all expected knowledge for the field. And while you probably should know what all these things are after being part of the community for a while it can be very daunting when it's all new.\n\nSo in creating this workshop I wanted to utilize all the knowledge I've accumulated over the past year while learning React to help speed the process for others. React has been a game changing technology for many – including myself – and I know it can be for others as well. They just need to know where to start.\n\n![Ian Working with student at Real World React Meetup](https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/rwr-ian-working-with-student.jpg)\n\n## So much fun\n\nSomething I wasn't entirely sure about going in was whether or not I would enjoy speaking. But after last Sunday I can firmly say that I _love_ it. This was a revelation for me. It was hugely fun to stand at the front of the class and speak about a technology I'm passionate about, and now I want to do more of it.\n\nMoving forward I'm going to pursue more speaking opportunities, including at conferences and tech schools here in SF. The goal will continue to be to provide as much value as possible to the students and/or audience members.\n\n## Room for improvement\n\nThe workshop went well, but it certainly wasn't perfect. There are quite a few things I would now change having done this once.\n\n### Rehearse\n\nYup, presentations go more smoothly if you've rehearsed them beforehand. Who knew? :sweat_smile: The presentations still went quite well considering I didn't have time to rehearse, but they could have been smoother.\n\n### Keep it concise\n\nOne of my \"lectures\" lasted a full 50 minutes. I was targeting 20 minutes and wildly overshot that, so clearly there are some wins to be had by reducing the content or splitting lectures into multiple parts. People's attentions spans are limited and as speakers we need to respect that.\n\n### No blank slates\n\nI had a chance to talk to Ryan Florence recently about teaching React. If you didn't know he teaches React for a living and has a lot of good advice when it comes to teaching it. I asked him about his teaching methods and he reminded me that in a real world scenario students will almost never be facing an empty file—they will instead be editing existing code.\n\nThis was something of a revelation for me. It makes perfect sense that at most companies you will be editing – not creating – new code, but it never crossed my mind. I work at a startup and have build all of my company's projects from scratch... but that's unusual.\n\n### Provide Scrum-like direction during exercises\n\nThis ties into the point above about not starting from scratch. Students would have benefited from more organized exercises with action lists that they could follow to completion. Instead I left it open ended and showed students the final app before asking them to build it from scratch.\n\nNext time I will provide more structure. Since many of the students at the workshop already work at companies they would likely be used to a Scrum-like project structure with minimal user stories and such.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nMy takeaways from this experience were:\n\n* Putting on a workshop can be a ton of fun\n* There's a serious market for learning React, especially here in SF\n* I really enjoyed speaking and am going to pursue it further\n\nTo that last point, I will be speaking at my first conference in a week about [building static sites with React][talk].\n\nWith all the current hype over React and React Native it really feels like React is eating the world.

I'll even show you how to integrate with a CI server :smile:. The trick is to use the Webpack [Node API][]_.\n\nEver built a [Webpack Plugin][]? Ever wondered how to test that awesome plugin you just built? If so, this article is for you.\n\nI scoured the internet (skimmed the first page of a google search) for resources on testing Webpack plugins and came up empty, so I decided it was time to take matters into my own hands!\n\nI recently built my own Webpack plugin for generating static sites from React Router routes. You can check it out [here if interested][static]. Anyway, I was getting somewhat annoyed that I hadn't yet tested the plugin. I had seen some regressions as I added support for more features and it was no fun to have to resolve those issues when I really just anted to generate awesome static sites using React and Webpack.\n\n## Where to turn...\n\nEven if the first page of a google search didn't answer my questions, I figured someone somewhere must have needed to test their Webpack plugins in the past, and I was right! My first move was to think about what popular Webpack plugins I was aware of. The first one that came to mind was the venerable [Extract Text Webpack Plugin][]. Little did I know, it was written by the same guy who wrote Webpack.\n\n[Extract Text Webpack Plugin]:https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin\n\nI figured that such a high profile plugin is likely to be well tested and it is. The plugin has a whole [suite of tests][extract tests] which you can check out and use as a reference for writing your own. Nice :boom:\n\n## Writing the tests\n\nLet's jump in. To write a tests for a Webpack plugin you will probably want to analyze the output of a build. To do so, you can simply use the [Node API][]. It runs in Node so it probably runs in your favorite test runner. For me this is [Ava][], but it's just Node code so you can use whatever you like.\n\nThe Webpack API let's you pass in options and a callback to Webpack. The callback will be called with an `err` object and some `stats` on how the build went. In short, here's the [exact test I use in my plugin][]:\n\n[exact test I use in my plugin]:https://github.com/iansinnott/react-static-webpack-plugin/blob/master/example/test.js\n\n```js\nimport test from 'ava';\nimport webpack from 'webpack';\n\n// 0. Import the config that uses my plugin\nimport options from './webpack.config.js';\n\ntest.cb('Compiles routes nested at one level', t => {\n\n  // 1. Run webpack\n  webpack(options, function(err, stats) {\n\n    // 2. Fail test if there are errors\n    if (err) {\n      return t.end(err);\n    } else if (stats.hasErrors()) {\n      return t.end(stats.toString());\n    }\n\n    // 3. Map asset objects to output filenames\n    const files = stats.toJson().assets.map(x => x.name);\n\n    // 4. Run assertions. Make sure that the three expected\n    //    HTML files were generated\n    t.true(files.indexOf('index.html') !== -1);\n    t.true(files.indexOf('about.html') !== -1);\n    t.true(files.indexOf('404.html') !== -1);\n\n    t.end();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis is a pretty simple test. Given the routes defined in [`routes.js`][routes], the plugin should generate three HTML files: `index.html`, `about.html` and `404.html`. This test simply runs Webpack and checks the output to make sure those three files were generated.

Ever wondered how to test that awesome plugin you just built?

My first move was to think about what popular Webpack plugins I was aware of. The first one that came to mind was the venerable [Extract Text Webpack Plugin][]. Little did I know, it was written by the same guy who wrote Webpack.\n\n[Extract Text Webpack Plugin]:https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin\n\nI figured that such a high profile plugin is likely to be well tested and it is. The plugin has a whole [suite of tests][extract tests] which you can check out and use as a reference for writing your own. Nice :boom:\n\n## Writing the tests\n\nLet's jump in. To write a tests for a Webpack plugin you will probably want to analyze the output of a build. To do so, you can simply use the [Node API][]. It runs in Node so it probably runs in your favorite test runner. For me this is [Ava][], but it's just Node code so you can use whatever you like.\n\nThe Webpack API let's you pass in options and a callback to Webpack. The callback will be called with an `err` object and some `stats` on how the build went. In short, here's the [exact test I use in my plugin][]:\n\n[exact test I use in my plugin]:https://github.com/iansinnott/react-static-webpack-plugin/blob/master/example/test.js\n\n```js\nimport test from 'ava';\nimport webpack from 'webpack';\n\n// 0. Import the config that uses my plugin\nimport options from './webpack.config.js';\n\ntest.cb('Compiles routes nested at one level', t => {\n\n  // 1. Run webpack\n  webpack(options, function(err, stats) {\n\n    // 2. Fail test if there are errors\n    if (err) {\n      return t.end(err);\n    } else if (stats.hasErrors()) {\n      return t.end(stats.toString());\n    }\n\n    // 3. Map asset objects to output filenames\n    const files = stats.toJson().assets.map(x => x.name);\n\n    // 4. Run assertions. Make sure that the three expected\n    //    HTML files were generated\n    t.true(files.indexOf('index.html') !== -1);\n    t.true(files.indexOf('about.html') !== -1);\n    t.true(files.indexOf('404.html') !== -1);\n\n    t.end();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis is a pretty simple test. Given the routes defined in [`routes.js`][routes], the plugin should generate three HTML files: `index.html`, `about.html` and `404.html`. This test simply runs Webpack and checks the output to make sure those three files were generated. It doesn't check the contents of those files or check that they were written to disk, but this test already gives me infinitely more code coverage than I had before.\n\nOf course it should be noted that I had to create a whole new directory and give it its own `package.json` and `node_modules` in order to get this test to run, but it works.\n\nAlso, looking at the Extract Plugin tests it looks like it may not be necessary to do a full `npm instal` for the subdirectory in order to run Webpack.

It is a static type checker for JavaScript. It let's you add types to any existing JS code. **Why would you want to do this?**  The short answer is because JS :heart: runtime errors, but runtime errors make your users sad. The more helpful answer is that Flow will analyze your codebase and catch bugs that may otherwise go unnoticed until you're app is already deployed to production. There is an entire site dedicated to explaining Flow, so I will let you check that out for more detailed information: <http://flowtype.org/>\n\nHowever, what may not be immediately obvious from the Flow site is the reason why it's so appealing for existing projects, which is that you can _iterate_ to full Flow coverage with minimal overhead.\n\nThat means you can keep on hitting all your existing dev milestones while adding Flow type coverage to your code in parallel. Flow is also designed to work with [Babel][], so if you're already using Babel in your toolchain you'll be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to set Flow up.\n\n### Webpack\n\nIf you're reading this post you probably already know what Webpack is, but just in case here's a two-sentence explanation: **Webpack is a module bundler that lets you split your JS code into separate files that can `import` or `require` each other**, much like Require.js or Browserify. In addition, it also lets you import assets such as CSS files and images directly in your JavaScript files.\n\nIn this post I'm going to show you how you can get set up using Webpack with Flow, which might be a bit daunting at first since Flow doesn't support all of Webpack's features (such as CSS importing) out of the box.\n\n## Getting Set Up\n\n```\nnpm install -g flow-bin\n```\n\nThat should be all you need to get the `flow` binary installed on your CLI.\n\n### Setting Up Webpack and Babel\n\nThis one will vary greatly depending on your projects, so I won't go over it here. What I will mention is that in order for Babel to properly compile Flow-typed code you will need to use the [Babel Flow plugin][]. If you're using `babel-plugin-react` then the Flow plugin should be included automatically.\n\n[Babel Flow plugin]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-flow-strip-types\n\n## Initial Flow Configuration\n\nOK, here's the meat of this post. Once you have Flow installed and are in your projects root directory you will be ready to configure Flow. Let's do it.\n\n**Create a `.flowconfig` file**\n\nYou can do this by running `flow init`.\n\nAfter running that command you should have a `.flowconfig` file in the current directory. Open up the file, since we will be editing it. You should see something like this initially:\n\n```\n[ignore]\n\n[include]\n\n[libs]\n\n[options]\n```\n\n**Test your configuation**\n\nRun `flow` from the root directory where you just created `.flowconfig`. It will take a few seconds to run the first time, but every time after should be almost instant.\n\nYou should see one of two things:\n\n1. `No errors!`\n2. A bunch of errors\n\nIf you see a bunch of errors after just setting up Flow that is because Flow type-checks _everything_, even all the code in your `node_modules`. Although it may be counter intuitive this is actually desired behavior, because Flow can warn you if you try to import anything that doesn't exist from `node_modules`.\n\nHowever, the downside is that when you first set up Flow you might see something like this:\n\n![Flow Errors](http://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen_Shot_2016-06-11_at_5_50_55_PM.png)\n\nIn this example Flow is detecting type errors in the `fbjs` module, which is required by React. Getting past this issue is simple enough, simply add a new ignore line to `.flowconfig`. I have no idea how regex works in OCaml, but luckily there's no need. The Flow docs provide plenty of examples to show us how to ignore a certain directory. The syntax is `.*/path/to/dir/.*`. So to ignore everything under `node_modules/fbjs` you can update your `.flowconfig` as follows:\n\n\n```ocaml\n[ignore]\n.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*\n\n[include]\n\n[libs]\n\n[options]\n```\n\nSince you haven't yet told Flow to type check any of your own code, every error you see is due to some third-party node module. That means its safe to ignore. Add more lines to the `[ignore]` section of `.flowconfig` until you've successfully ignored any offending node modules.\n\nNow you should see `No errors!` on the command line when you run `flow`.\n\nWhew, time to move on to the fun part: Typing your own code!\n\n## Type checking our own code\n\nTo type check any of your js/jsx files with Flow simply add `/* @flow */` to the top of the file. This will make it visible to Flow. I would recommend doing this only one file at a time and fixing any errors that Flow catches in that file _before_ type-checking any new files. This strategy is simply meant to keep the number of errors from seeming overwhelming, since untyped code can often have a ton of errors.\n\nIt is also worth noting that if the errors are so many that they seem daunting you can use `/* @flow weak */` to turn on a weaker type-checking mode in Flow that will likely produce fewer errors. Once you have all those errors handled you can revert back to `/* @flow */` and handle the more strict errors. Using Flow in it's most strict mode is how it was meant to be used, and will ultimately provide you with the most safety.\n\n## Advanced Configuration: CSS Modules, Image files, ES7, etc\n\n### CSS Modules\n\nAll right, we made it to the Webpack specific part of this post. Let's talk about making CSS Modules type-check with Flow. If you're not using CSS Modules you can safely skip this section, but you may also want to [check them out][CSS Modules] since CSS Modules can be a big win for the maintainability of a codebase.\n\nUsing CSS Modules with Webpack looks something like this:\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { render } from 'react-dom';\nimport s from './App.css'; // CSS Modules!\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className={s.App}>\n        <h1>My App</h1>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nrender(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n```\n\nThe important part of that code is line 3, where we import `s` from a CSS file. Further down in the `render` method of `App` we see that `s` is expected to be a JavaScript object. However, Flow doesn't know this and it will complain as soon as it sees us trying to import a module named `App.css`. Flow will look for the `./App.css` JS module and find nothing, so it will throw an error:\n\n```\nsrc/components/App.js:3\n  3: import s from './App.css';\n                   ^^^^^^^^^^^ ./App.css. Required module not found\n```\n\nTo solve this issue, we need to tell Flow to that for CSS files it should actually look for type definitions somewhere else. I'll describe how to do this briefly here, but there is also a good section on the Flow website that describes how to accomplish this: <https://flowtype.org/docs/modules.html#css-modules-with-webpack>\n\nCreate a new directory named `flow` and a new file within that directory: `flow/CSSModule.js.flow`. Now add the following to `CSSModule.js.flow`:\n\n```\n// @flow\n\ndeclare export default { [key: string]: string }\n```\n\nWhen Flow reads this file it will see a default export of a plain JavaScript object that maps string keys to string values, which is exactly the case for CSS modules.\n\nThe last step to make this work is to tell Flow which file extensions should use this `CSSModule.js.flow` file. We do that in the `[options]` section of our `.flowconfig`:\n\n```ocaml\n[ignore]\n.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*\n\n[include]\n\n[libs]\n\n[options]\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='css' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='styl' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'\n```\n\nThe first line under `[options]` tells Flow that for every file with the `.css` extension it should read type info from the `CSSModule.js.flow` file we just created.\n\n**Note** that you can map multiple extensions in the options section. In my case, I use [Stylus][] to author my CSS which means I needed to add the `.styl` extension as another filetype that should be interpreted as a CSS module. You can add support for Less and Sass in the same way.\n\n[Flow]: http://flowtype.org/\n[Webpack]: https://webpack.github.io/\n[Babel]: http://babeljs.io/\n[Stylus]: http://stylus-lang.com/\n\n### Image Files\n\nSince Webpack also lets you `import` image files we will want to add support for that as well. The process looks much the same as it did for CSS modules above: We need to create a new type definitions file that will be read for files with certain extensions. The only difference here is that our image files are imported as strings, not JavaScript objects as with CSS modules.\n\nCreate another file: `flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow`. Now add the following to `WebpackAsset.js.flow`:\n\n```\n// @flow\n\ndeclare export default string\n```\n\nThen tell Flow about this file in your `.flowconfig`:\n\n```ocaml\n[ignore]\n.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*\n\n[include]\n\n[libs]\n\n[options]\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='css' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='styl' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='png' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow'\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='jpg' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow'\n```\n\nIn the above configuration file we tell Flow to use our `WebpackAsset.js.flow`\nfile in place of any file with a `.png` or `.jpg` extension.\n\nNow Flow will happily type code like this:\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { render } from 'react-dom';\nimport s from './App.css'; // CSS Modules!\nimport logo from './logo.png'; // Image Files!\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className={s.App}>\n        <h1>My App</h1>\n        <img src={logo} alt='App Logo' />\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nrender(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n```\n\nPretty slick, right? :sunglasses:\n\n**NOTE:** You will need to have the proper module loaders set up with Webpack\nfor this to even work in the first place\n\n### ES7 Class Support\n\nIf you're authoring React code you may well be interested in compile ES7-style\nclass syntax with babel. This things like `static propTypes = {}`,`state\n= {}`, etc. For example, here's a `Counter` component written using ES7 class\nsyntax:\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nimport s from './Counter.css';\n\nclass Counter extends React.Component {\n  static propTypes = {\n    color: React.PropTypes.string,\n  };\n\n  static defaultProps = {\n    initialCount: 0,\n  };\n\n  state = {\n    count: this.props.initialCount,\n  };\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })\n  };\n\n  decrement = () => {\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 })\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className={s.Counter}>\n        <h1>Count: {this.state.count}</h1>\n        <div className={s.controls}>\n          <button onClick={this.decrement}>-</button>\n          <button onClick={this.increment}>+</button>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you're not familiar with this syntax check out this blog post on the Babel\nwebsite: <https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/06/07/react-on-es6-plus>\n\n**NOTE:** At the time of this writing Flow requires semicolons after property\ninitializers in order to type check effectively, even though Babel does not\nrequire this.\n\nIn order to allow code like that above we need to update the `[options]`\nsection of `.flowconfig` again:\n\n```ocaml\n[ignore]\n.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*\n\n[include]\n\n[libs]\n\n[options]\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='css' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='styl' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='png' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow'\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='jpg' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow'\nesproposal.class_static_fields=enable\nesproposal.class_instance_fields=enable\n```\n\nWe've added two new lines to tell Flow we want to support this new class\nsyntax:\n\n```\nesproposal.class_static_fields=enable\nesproposal.class_instance_fields=enable\n```\n\n### Ignore Single Lines in Flow\n\nThe last Flow trick I'll show you today is how to tell Flow to ignore single lines in your code. Just like with ESLint, it can be useful to be able to ignore just one line in a file. There are usually two reasons you would want to do this:\n\n1. The code in question needs to be refactored to be properly typed but it\nwould take too much time or effort to do it now\n2. Flow does not yet support some feature or has a bug\n\nThe first point is pretty obvious, but the second may come as a surprise. Flow is very advanced and very useful _today_ but it is not without its own bugs or missing features, so there may be times when you need to tell Flow to ignore a line for reason number two.\n\nThe way to ignore single lines is by using the `supress_comment` option within your `.flowconfig`. Let's define two ignore patterns so that we can differentiate between the two types of reasons to ignore listed above:\n\n```\nsuppress_comment=\\\\(.\\\\|\\n\\\\)*\\\\$FlowFixMe\nsuppress_comment=\\\\(.\\\\|\\n\\\\)*\\\\$FlowIssue\n```\n\nNow anywhere in our code where we want Flow to ignore a line we can place a\ncomment on the proceeding line:\n\n```js\n// $FlowFixMe: We aren't yet ready to refactor this line...\nfunction manyUntypedArgs(a, b, x, y) { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThat's it! These are the tricks I've found to be most useful in my day to day\nusage of Flow so far.\n\nHere's the full `.flowconfig` we created throughout this post for your\nreference:\n\n```ocaml\n[ignore]\n.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*\n\n[include]\n\n[libs]\n\n[options]\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='css' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='styl' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='png' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow'\nmodule.name_mapper.extension='jpg' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow'\nesproposal.class_static_fields=enable\nesproposal.class_instance_fields=enable\nsuppress_comment=\\\\(.\\\\|\\n\\\\)*\\\\$FlowFixMe\nsuppress_comment=\\\\(.\\\\|\\n\\\\)*\\\\$FlowIssue\n```\n\nYou may have other options you need to make to your `.flowconfig`, such as\ndefining a directory for your [declaration files][]. But hopefully this\nconfiguration helps get you started with Flow and Webpack! Big wins ahead.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to lave a comment below or [hit me up on\ntwitter](https://twitter.com/ian_sinn).\n\n[declaration files]: https://flowtype.org/docs/declarations.html\n","source":"_posts/2016-06-11-getting-started-with-flow-and-webpack.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Getting Started with Flow and Webpack\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** This post will show you how to get set up with [Flow][] and [Webpack][] as quickly as possible so that you can benefit from some degree of type safety in your JS code!\n\n## What are we talking about?\n\n### Flow\n\n[Flow][] is like ESLint on steroids. It is a static type checker for JavaScript. It let's you add types to any existing JS code. **Why would you want to do this?**  The short answer is because JS :heart: runtime errors, but runtime errors make your users sad. The more helpful answer is that Flow will analyze your codebase and catch bugs that may otherwise go unnoticed until you're app is already deployed to production. There is an entire site dedicated to explaining Flow, so I will let you check that out for more detailed information: <http://flowtype.org/>\n\nHowever, what may not be immediately obvious from the Flow site is the reason why it's so appealing for existing projects, which is that you can _iterate_ to full Flow coverage with minimal overhead.\n\nThat means you can keep on hitting all your existing dev milestones while adding Flow type coverage to your code in parallel. Flow is also designed to work with [Babel][], so if you're already using Babel in your toolchain you'll be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to set Flow up.\n\n### Webpack\n\nIf you're reading this post you probably already know what Webpack is, but just in case here's a two-sentence explanation: **Webpack is a module bundler that lets you split your JS code into separate files that can `import` or `require` each other**, much like Require.js or Browserify. In addition, it also lets you import assets such as CSS files and images directly in your JavaScript files.\n\nIn this post I'm going to show you how you can get set up using Webpack with Flow, which might be a bit daunting at first since Flow doesn't support all of Webpack's features (such as CSS importing) out of the box.\n\n## Getting Set Up\n\n```\nnpm install -g flow-bin\n```\n\nThat should be all you need to get the `flow` binary installed on your CLI.\n\n### Setting Up Webpack and Babel\n\nThis one will vary greatly depending on your projects, so I won't go over it here. What I will mention is that in order for Babel to properly compile Flow-typed code you will need to use the [Babel Flow plugin][]. If you're using `babel-plugin-react` then the Flow plugin should be included automatically.\n\n[Babel Flow plugin]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-flow-strip-types\n\n## Initial Flow Configuration\n\nOK, here's the meat of this post. Once you have Flow installed and are in your projects root directory you will be ready to configure Flow. Let's do it.\n\n**Create a `.flowconfig` file**\n\nYou can do this by running `flow init`.\n\nAfter running that command you should have a `.flowconfig` file in the current directory. Open up the file, since we will be editing it. You should see something like this initially:\n\n```\n[ignore]\n\n[include]\n\n[libs]\n\n[options]\n```\n\n**Test your configuation**\n\nRun `flow` from the root directory where you just created `.flowconfig`. It will take a few seconds to run the first time, but every time after should be almost instant.\n\nYou should see one of two things:\n\n1. `No errors!`\n2. A bunch of errors\n\nIf you see a bunch of errors after just setting up Flow that is because Flow type-checks _everything_, even all the code in your `node_modules`. Although it may be counter intuitive this is actually desired behavior, because Flow can warn you if you try to import anything that doesn't exist from `node_modules`.\n\nHowever, the downside is that when you first set up Flow you might see something like this:\n\n![Flow Errors](http://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen_Shot_2016-06-11_at_5_50_55_PM.png)\n\nIn this example Flow is detecting type errors in the `fbjs` module, which is required by React. Getting past this issue is simple enough, simply add a new ignore line to `.flowconfig`. I have no idea how regex works in OCaml, but luckily there's no need. The Flow docs provide plenty of examples to show us how to ignore a certain directory. The syntax is `.*/path/to/dir/.*`. So to ignore everything under `node_modules/fbjs` you can update your `.flowconfig` as follows:\n\n\n```ocaml\n[ignore]\n.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*\n\n[include]\n\n[libs]\n\n[options]\n```\n\nSince you haven't yet told Flow to type check any of your own code, every error you see is due to some third-party node module. That means its safe to ignore. Add more lines to the `[ignore]` section of `.flowconfig` until you've successfully ignored any offending node modules.\n\nNow you should see `No errors!` on the command line when you run `flow`.\n\nWhew, time to move on to the fun part: Typing your own code!\n\n## Type checking our own code\n\nTo type check any of your js/jsx files with Flow simply add `/* @flow */` to the top of the file. This will make it visible to Flow. I would recommend doing this only one file at a time and fixing any errors that Flow catches in that file _before_ type-checking any new files. This strategy is simply meant to keep the number of errors from seeming overwhelming, since untyped code can often have a ton of errors.\n\nIt is also worth noting that if the errors are so many that they seem daunting you can use `/* @flow weak */` to turn on a weaker type-checking mode in Flow that will likely produce fewer errors. Once you have all those errors handled you can revert back to `/* @flow */` and handle the more strict errors. Using Flow in it's most strict mode is how it was meant to be used, and will ultimately provide you with the most safety.\n\n## Advanced Configuration: CSS Modules, Image files, ES7, etc\n\n### CSS Modules\n\nAll right, we made it to the Webpack specific part of this post. Let's talk about making CSS Modules type-check with Flow.

Further down in the `render` method of `App` we see that `s` is expected to be a JavaScript object.

Flow is also designed to work with <a href=\"http://babeljs.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Babel</a>, so if you’re already using Babel in your toolchain you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to set Flow up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Webpack\"><a href=\"#Webpack\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Webpack\"></a>Webpack</h3><p>If you’re reading this post you probably already know what Webpack is, but just in case here’s a two-sentence explanation: <strong>Webpack is a module bundler that lets you split your JS code into separate files that can <code>import</code> or <code>require</code> each other</strong>, much like Require.js or Browserify. In addition, it also lets you import assets such as CSS files and images directly in your JavaScript files.</p>\n<p>In this post I’m going to show you how you can get set up using Webpack with Flow, which might be a bit daunting at first since Flow doesn’t support all of Webpack’s features (such as CSS importing) out of the box.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Getting-Set-Up\"><a href=\"#Getting-Set-Up\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Getting Set Up\"></a>Getting Set Up</h2><figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">npm install -g flow-bin</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>That should be all you need to get the <code>flow</code> binary installed on your CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Setting-Up-Webpack-and-Babel\"><a href=\"#Setting-Up-Webpack-and-Babel\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Setting Up Webpack and Babel\"></a>Setting Up Webpack and Babel</h3><p>This one will vary greatly depending on your projects, so I won’t go over it here. What I will mention is that in order for Babel to properly compile Flow-typed code you will need to use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-flow-strip-types\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Babel Flow plugin</a>. If you’re using <code>babel-plugin-react</code> then the Flow plugin should be included automatically.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Initial-Flow-Configuration\"><a href=\"#Initial-Flow-Configuration\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Initial Flow Configuration\"></a>Initial Flow Configuration</h2><p>OK, here’s the meat of this post. Once you have Flow installed and are in your projects root directory you will be ready to configure Flow. Let’s do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Create a <code>.flowconfig</code> file</strong></p>\n<p>You can do this by running <code>flow init</code>.</p>\n<p>After running that command you should have a <code>.flowconfig</code> file in the current directory. Open up the file, since we will be editing it. You should see something like this initially:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">[ignore]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[include]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[libs]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[options]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p><strong>Test your configuation</strong></p>\n<p>Run <code>flow</code> from the root directory where you just created <code>.flowconfig</code>. It will take a few seconds to run the first time, but every time after should be almost instant.</p>\n<p>You should see one of two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>No errors!</code></li>\n<li>A bunch of errors</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you see a bunch of errors after just setting up Flow that is because Flow type-checks <em>everything</em>, even all the code in your <code>node_modules</code>. Although it may be counter intuitive this is actually desired behavior, because Flow can warn you if you try to import anything that doesn’t exist from <code>node_modules</code>.</p>\n<p>However, the downside is that when you first set up Flow you might see something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen_Shot_2016-06-11_at_5_50_55_PM.png\" alt=\"Flow Errors\"></p>\n<p>In this example Flow is detecting type errors in the <code>fbjs</code> module, which is required by React. Getting past this issue is simple enough, simply add a new ignore line to <code>.flowconfig</code>. I have no idea how regex works in OCaml, but luckily there’s no need. The Flow docs provide plenty of examples to show us how to ignore a certain directory. The syntax is <code>.*/path/to/dir/.*</code>. So to ignore everything under <code>node_modules/fbjs</code> you can update your <code>.flowconfig</code> as follows:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight ocaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">[ignore]</div><div class=\"line\">.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[<span class=\"keyword\">include</span>]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[libs]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[options]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Since you haven’t yet told Flow to type check any of your own code, every error you see is due to some third-party node module. That means its safe to ignore. Add more lines to the <code>[ignore]</code> section of <code>.flowconfig</code> until you’ve successfully ignored any offending node modules.</p>\n<p>Now you should see <code>No errors!</code> on the command line when you run <code>flow</code>.</p>\n<p>Whew, time to move on to the fun part: Typing your own code!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Type-checking-our-own-code\"><a href=\"#Type-checking-our-own-code\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Type checking our own code\"></a>Type checking our own code</h2><p>To type check any of your js/jsx files with Flow simply add <code>/* @flow */</code> to the top of the file. This will make it visible to Flow. I would recommend doing this only one file at a time and fixing any errors that Flow catches in that file <em>before</em> type-checking any new files. This strategy is simply meant to keep the number of errors from seeming overwhelming, since untyped code can often have a ton of errors.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that if the errors are so many that they seem daunting you can use <code>/* @flow weak */</code> to turn on a weaker type-checking mode in Flow that will likely produce fewer errors. Once you have all those errors handled you can revert back to <code>/* @flow */</code> and handle the more strict errors. Using Flow in it’s most strict mode is how it was meant to be used, and will ultimately provide you with the most safety.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Advanced-Configuration-CSS-Modules-Image-files-ES7-etc\"><a href=\"#Advanced-Configuration-CSS-Modules-Image-files-ES7-etc\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Advanced Configuration: CSS Modules, Image files, ES7, etc\"></a>Advanced Configuration: CSS Modules, Image files, ES7, etc</h2><h3 id=\"CSS-Modules\"><a href=\"#CSS-Modules\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"CSS Modules\"></a>CSS Modules</h3><p>All right, we made it to the Webpack specific part of this post. Let’s talk about making CSS Modules type-check with Flow. If you’re not using CSS Modules you can safely skip this section, but you may also want to [check them out][CSS Modules] since CSS Modules can be a big win for the maintainability of a codebase.</p>\n<p>Using CSS Modules with Webpack looks something like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> React <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'react'</span>;</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> &#123; render &#125; <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'react-dom'</span>;</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> s <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'./App.css'</span>; <span class=\"comment\">// CSS Modules!</span></div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">App</span> <span class=\"keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"title\">React</span>.<span class=\"title\">Component</span> </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  render() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> (</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;div className=&#123;s.App&#125;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">        &lt;h1&gt;My App&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;/div&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    );</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.getElementById('root'));</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The important part of that code is line 3, where we import <code>s</code> from a CSS file. Further down in the <code>render</code> method of <code>App</code> we see that <code>s</code> is expected to be a JavaScript object. However, Flow doesn’t know this and it will complain as soon as it sees us trying to import a module named <code>App.css</code>. Flow will look for the <code>./App.css</code> JS module and find nothing, so it will throw an error:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">src/components/App.js:3</div><div class=\"line\">  3: import s from &apos;./App.css&apos;;</div><div class=\"line\">                   ^^^^^^^^^^^ ./App.css. Required module not found</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>To solve this issue, we need to tell Flow to that for CSS files it should actually look for type definitions somewhere else. I’ll describe how to do this briefly here, but there is also a good section on the Flow website that describes how to accomplish this: <a href=\"https://flowtype.org/docs/modules.html#css-modules-with-webpack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">https://flowtype.org/docs/modules.html#css-modules-with-webpack</a></p>\n<p>Create a new directory named <code>flow</code> and a new file within that directory: <code>flow/CSSModule.js.flow</code>. Now add the following to <code>CSSModule.js.flow</code>:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">// @flow</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">declare export default &#123; [key: string]: string &#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>When Flow reads this file it will see a default export of a plain JavaScript object that maps string keys to string values, which is exactly the case for CSS modules.</p>\n<p>The last step to make this work is to tell Flow which file extensions should use this <code>CSSModule.js.flow</code> file. We do that in the <code>[options]</code> section of our <code>.flowconfig</code>:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight ocaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">[ignore]</div><div class=\"line\">.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[<span class=\"keyword\">include</span>]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[libs]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[options]</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">module</span>.name_mapper.extension=<span class=\"symbol\">'css'</span> -&gt; <span class=\"string\">'&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">module</span>.name_mapper.extension=<span class=\"symbol\">'styl'</span> -&gt; <span class=\"string\">'&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'</span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The first line under <code>[options]</code> tells Flow that for every file with the <code>.css</code> extension it should read type info from the <code>CSSModule.js.flow</code> file we just created.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that you can map multiple extensions in the options section. In my case, I use <a href=\"http://stylus-lang.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Stylus</a> to author my CSS which means I needed to add the <code>.styl</code> extension as another filetype that should be interpreted as a CSS module. You can add support for Less and Sass in the same way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Image-Files\"><a href=\"#Image-Files\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Image Files\"></a>Image Files</h3><p>Since Webpack also lets you <code>import</code> image files we will want to add support for that as well. The process looks much the same as it did for CSS modules above: We need to create a new type definitions file that will be read for files with certain extensions. The only difference here is that our image files are imported as strings, not JavaScript objects as with CSS modules.</p>\n<p>Create another file: <code>flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow</code>. Now add the following to <code>WebpackAsset.js.flow</code>:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">// @flow</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">declare export default string</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Then tell Flow about this file in your <code>.flowconfig</code>:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight ocaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">[ignore]</div><div class=\"line\">.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[<span class=\"keyword\">include</span>]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[libs]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[options]</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">module</span>.name_mapper.extension=<span class=\"symbol\">'css'</span> -&gt; <span class=\"string\">'&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">module</span>.name_mapper.extension=<span class=\"symbol\">'styl'</span> -&gt; <span class=\"string\">'&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">module</span>.name_mapper.extension=<span class=\"symbol\">'png'</span> -&gt; <span class=\"string\">'&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow'</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">module</span>.name_mapper.extension=<span class=\"symbol\">'jpg'</span> -&gt; <span class=\"string\">'&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow'</span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>In the above configuration file we tell Flow to use our <code>WebpackAsset.js.flow</code><br>file in place of any file with a <code>.png</code> or <code>.jpg</code> extension.</p>\n<p>Now Flow will happily type code like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div><div class=\"line\">16</div><div class=\"line\">17</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> React <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'react'</span>;</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> &#123; render &#125; <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'react-dom'</span>;</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> s <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'./App.css'</span>; <span class=\"comment\">// CSS Modules!</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> logo <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'./logo.png'</span>; <span class=\"comment\">// Image Files!</span></div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">App</span> <span class=\"keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"title\">React</span>.<span class=\"title\">Component</span> </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  render() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> (</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;div className=&#123;s.App&#125;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">        &lt;h1&gt;My App&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">        &lt;img src=&#123;logo&#125; alt='App Logo' /&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;/div&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    );</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.getElementById('root'));</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Pretty slick, right? :sunglasses:</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You will need to have the proper module loaders set up with Webpack<br>for this to even work in the first place</p>\n<h3 id=\"ES7-Class-Support\"><a href=\"#ES7-Class-Support\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ES7 Class Support\"></a>ES7 Class Support</h3><p>If you’re authoring React code you may well be interested in compile ES7-style<br>class syntax with babel.

Flow is very advanced and very useful <em>today</em> but it is not without its own bugs or missing features, so there may be times when you need to tell Flow to ignore a line for reason number two.</p>\n<p>The way to ignore single lines is by using the <code>supress_comment</code> option within your <code>.flowconfig</code>. Let’s define two ignore patterns so that we can differentiate between the two types of reasons to ignore listed above:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">suppress_comment=\\\\(.\\\\|\\n\\\\)*\\\\$FlowFixMe</div><div class=\"line\">suppress_comment=\\\\(.\\\\|\\n\\\\)*\\\\$FlowIssue</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now anywhere in our code where we want Flow to ignore a line we can place a<br>comment on the proceeding line:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// $FlowFixMe: We aren't yet ready to refactor this line...</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">manyUntypedArgs</span>(<span class=\"params\">a, b, x, y</span>) </span>&#123; <span class=\"comment\">/* ... */</span> &#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>That’s it! These are the tricks I’ve found to be most useful in my day to day<br>usage of Flow so far.</p>\n<p>Here’s the full <code>.flowconfig</code> we created throughout this post for your<br>reference:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight ocaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div><div class=\"line\">16</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">[ignore]</div><div class=\"line\">.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[<span class=\"keyword\">include</span>]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[libs]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[options]</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">module</span>.name_mapper.extension=<span class=\"symbol\">'css'</span> -&gt; <span class=\"string\">'&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">module</span>.name_mapper.extension=<span class=\"symbol\">'styl'</span> -&gt; <span class=\"string\">'&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">module</span>.name_mapper.extension=<span class=\"symbol\">'png'</span> -&gt; <span class=\"string\">'&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow'</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">module</span>.name_mapper.extension=<span class=\"symbol\">'jpg'</span> -&gt; <span class=\"string\">'&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow'</span></div><div class=\"line\">esproposal.class_static_fields=enable</div><div class=\"line\">esproposal.class_instance_fields=enable</div><div class=\"line\">suppress_comment=\\\\(.\\\\|\\n\\\\)*\\\\$<span class=\"type\">FlowFixMe</span></div><div class=\"line\">suppress_comment=\\\\(.\\\\|\\n\\\\)*\\\\$<span class=\"type\">FlowIssue</span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>You may have other options you need to make to your <code>.flowconfig</code>, such as<br>defining a directory for your <a href=\"https://flowtype.org/docs/declarations.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">declaration files</a>. But hopefully this<br>configuration helps get you started with Flow and Webpack! Big wins ahead.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions feel free to lave a comment below or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ian_sinn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">hit me up on<br>twitter</a>.</p>\n","excerpt":"","more":"<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This post will show you how to get set up with <a href=\"http://flowtype.org/\">Flow</a> and <a href=\"https://webpack.github.io/\">Webpack</a> as quickly as possible so that you can benefit from some degree of type safety in your JS code!</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-are-we-talking-about\"><a href=\"#What-are-we-talking-about\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What are we talking about?\"></a>What are we talking about?</h2><h3 id=\"Flow\"><a href=\"#Flow\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Flow\"></a>Flow</h3><p><a href=\"http://flowtype.org/\">Flow</a> is like ESLint on steroids. It is a static type checker for JavaScript. It let’s you add types to any existing JS code. <strong>Why would you want to do this?</strong>  The short answer is because JS :heart: runtime errors, but runtime errors make your users sad. The more helpful answer is that Flow will analyze your codebase and catch bugs that may otherwise go unnoticed until you’re app is already deployed to production. There is an entire site dedicated to explaining Flow, so I will let you check that out for more detailed information: <a href=\"http://flowtype.org/\">http://flowtype.org/</a></p>\n<p>However, what may not be immediately obvious from the Flow site is the reason why it’s so appealing for existing projects, which is that you can <em>iterate</em> to full Flow coverage with minimal overhead.</p>\n<p>That means you can keep on hitting all your existing dev milestones while adding Flow type coverage to your code in parallel. Flow is also designed to work with <a href=\"http://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a>, so if you’re already using Babel in your toolchain you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to set Flow up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Webpack\"><a href=\"#Webpack\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Webpack\"></a>Webpack</h3><p>If you’re reading this post you probably already know what Webpack is, but just in case here’s a two-sentence explanation: <strong>Webpack is a module bundler that lets you split your JS code into separate files that can <code>import</code> or <code>require</code> each other</strong>, much like Require.js or Browserify. In addition, it also lets you import assets such as CSS files and images directly in your JavaScript files.</p>\n<p>In this post I’m going to show you how you can get set up using Webpack with Flow, which might be a bit daunting at first since Flow doesn’t support all of Webpack’s features (such as CSS importing) out of the box.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Getting-Set-Up\"><a href=\"#Getting-Set-Up\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Getting Set Up\"></a>Getting Set Up</h2><figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">npm install -g flow-bin</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>That should be all you need to get the <code>flow</code> binary installed on your CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Setting-Up-Webpack-and-Babel\"><a href=\"#Setting-Up-Webpack-and-Babel\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Setting Up Webpack and Babel\"></a>Setting Up Webpack and Babel</h3><p>This one will vary greatly depending on your projects, so I won’t go over it here. What I will mention is that in order for Babel to properly compile Flow-typed code you will need to use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-flow-strip-types\">Babel Flow plugin</a>. If you’re using <code>babel-plugin-react</code> then the Flow plugin should be included automatically.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Initial-Flow-Configuration\"><a href=\"#Initial-Flow-Configuration\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Initial Flow Configuration\"></a>Initial Flow Configuration</h2><p>OK, here’s the meat of this post. Once you have Flow installed and are in your projects root directory you will be ready to configure Flow. Let’s do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Create a <code>.flowconfig</code> file</strong></p>\n<p>You can do this by running <code>flow init</code>.</p>\n<p>After running that command you should have a <code>.flowconfig</code> file in the current directory. Open up the file, since we will be editing it. You should see something like this initially:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">[ignore]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[include]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[libs]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[options]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p><strong>Test your configuation</strong></p>\n<p>Run <code>flow</code> from the root directory where you just created <code>.flowconfig</code>. It will take a few seconds to run the first time, but every time after should be almost instant.</p>\n<p>You should see one of two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>No errors!</code></li>\n<li>A bunch of errors</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you see a bunch of errors after just setting up Flow that is because Flow type-checks <em>everything</em>, even all the code in your <code>node_modules</code>. Although it may be counter intuitive this is actually desired behavior, because Flow can warn you if you try to import anything that doesn’t exist from <code>node_modules</code>.</p>\n<p>However, the downside is that when you first set up Flow you might see something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen_Shot_2016-06-11_at_5_50_55_PM.png\" alt=\"Flow Errors\"></p>\n<p>In this example Flow is detecting type errors in the <code>fbjs</code> module, which is required by React. Getting past this issue is simple enough, simply add a new ignore line to <code>.flowconfig</code>. I have no idea how regex works in OCaml, but luckily there’s no need. The Flow docs provide plenty of examples to show us how to ignore a certain directory. The syntax is <code>.*/path/to/dir/.*</code>. So to ignore everything under <code>node_modules/fbjs</code> you can update your <code>.flowconfig</code> as follows:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight ocaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">[ignore]</div><div class=\"line\">.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[<span class=\"keyword\">include</span>]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[libs]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[options]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Since you haven’t yet told Flow to type check any of your own code, every error you see is due to some third-party node module. That means its safe to ignore. Add more lines to the <code>[ignore]</code> section of <code>.flowconfig</code> until you’ve successfully ignored any offending node modules.</p>\n<p>Now you should see <code>No errors!</code> on the command line when you run <code>flow</code>.</p>\n<p>Whew, time to move on to the fun part: Typing your own code!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Type-checking-our-own-code\"><a href=\"#Type-checking-our-own-code\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Type checking our own code\"></a>Type checking our own code</h2><p>To type check any of your js/jsx files with Flow simply add <code>/* @flow */</code> to the top of the file. This will make it visible to Flow. I would recommend doing this only one file at a time and fixing any errors that Flow catches in that file <em>before</em> type-checking any new files. This strategy is simply meant to keep the number of errors from seeming overwhelming, since untyped code can often have a ton of errors.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that if the errors are so many that they seem daunting you can use <code>/* @flow weak */</code> to turn on a weaker type-checking mode in Flow that will likely produce fewer errors. Once you have all those errors handled you can revert back to <code>/* @flow */</code> and handle the more strict errors. Using Flow in it’s most strict mode is how it was meant to be used, and will ultimately provide you with the most safety.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Advanced-Configuration-CSS-Modules-Image-files-ES7-etc\"><a href=\"#Advanced-Configuration-CSS-Modules-Image-files-ES7-etc\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Advanced Configuration: CSS Modules, Image files, ES7, etc\"></a>Advanced Configuration: CSS Modules, Image files, ES7, etc</h2><h3 id=\"CSS-Modules\"><a href=\"#CSS-Modules\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"CSS Modules\"></a>CSS Modules</h3><p>All right, we made it to the Webpack specific part of this post. Let’s talk about making CSS Modules type-check with Flow. If you’re not using CSS Modules you can safely skip this section, but you may also want to [check them out][CSS Modules] since CSS Modules can be a big win for the maintainability of a codebase.</p>\n<p>Using CSS Modules with Webpack looks something like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div><div class=\"line\">11</div><div class=\"line\">12</div><div class=\"line\">13</div><div class=\"line\">14</div><div class=\"line\">15</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> React <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'react'</span>;</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> &#123; render &#125; <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'react-dom'</span>;</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> s <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'./App.css'</span>; <span class=\"comment\">// CSS Modules!</span></div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">App</span> <span class=\"keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"title\">React</span>.<span class=\"title\">Component</span> </span>&#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  render() &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> (</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;div className=&#123;s.App&#125;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">        &lt;h1&gt;My App&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;/div&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    );</div><div class=\"line\">  &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.getElementById('root'));</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The important part of that code is line 3, where we import <code>s</code> from a CSS file. Further down in the <code>render</code> method of <code>App</code> we see that <code>s</code> is expected to be a JavaScript object. However, Flow doesn’t know this and it will complain as soon as it sees us trying to import a module named <code>App.css</code>. Flow will look for the <code>./App.css</code> JS module and find nothing, so it will throw an error:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">src/components/App.js:3</div><div class=\"line\">  3: import s from &apos;./App.css&apos;;</div><div class=\"line\">                   ^^^^^^^^^^^ ./App.css. Required module not found</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>To solve this issue, we need to tell Flow to that for CSS files it should actually look for type definitions somewhere else. I’ll describe how to do this briefly here, but there is also a good section on the Flow website that describes how to accomplish this: <a href=\"https://flowtype.org/docs/modules.html#css-modules-with-webpack\">https://flowtype.org/docs/modules.html#css-modules-with-webpack</a></p>\n<p>Create a new directory named <code>flow</code> and a new file within that directory: <code>flow/CSSModule.js.flow</code>. Now add the following to <code>CSSModule.js.flow</code>:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">// @flow</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">declare export default &#123; [key: string]: string &#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>When Flow reads this file it will see a default export of a plain JavaScript object that maps string keys to string values, which is exactly the case for CSS modules.</p>\n<p>The last step to make this work is to tell Flow which file extensions should use this <code>CSSModule.js.flow</code> file. We do that in the <code>[options]</code> section of our <code>.flowconfig</code>:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight ocaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div><div class=\"line\">10</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">[ignore]</div><div class=\"line\">.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[<span class=\"keyword\">include</span>]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[libs]</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">[options]</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">module</span>.name_mapper.extension=<span class=\"symbol\">'css'</span> -&gt; <span class=\"string\">'&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">module</span>.name_mapper.extension=<span class=\"symbol\">'styl'</span> -&gt; <span class=\"string\">'&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/flow/CSSModule.js.flow'</span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The first line under <code>[options]</code> tells Flow that for every file with the <code>.css</code> extension it should read type info from the <code>CSSModule.js.flow</code> file we just created.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that you can map multiple extensions in the options section. In my case, I use <a href=\"http://stylus-lang.com/\">Stylus</a> to author my CSS which means I needed to add the <code>.styl</code> extension as another filetype that should be interpreted as a CSS module. You can add support for Less and Sass in the same way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Image-Files\"><a href=\"#Image-Files\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Image Files\"></a>Image Files</h3><p>Since Webpack also lets you <code>import</code> image files we will want to add support for that as well. The process looks much the same as it did for CSS modules above: We need to create a new type definitions file that will be read for files with certain extensions. The only difference here is that our image files are imported as strings, not JavaScript objects as with CSS modules.</p>\n<p>Create another file: <code>flow/WebpackAsset.js.flow</code>.

Just like with ESLint, it can be useful to be able to ignore just one line in a file. There are usually two reasons you would want to do this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The code in question needs to be refactored to be properly typed but it<br>would take too much time or effort to do it now</li>\n<li>Flow does not yet support some feature or has a bug</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first point is pretty obvious, but the second may come as a surprise. Flow is very advanced and very useful <em>today</em> but it is not without its own bugs or missing features, so there may be times when you need to tell Flow to ignore a line for reason number two.</p>\n<p>The way to ignore single lines is by using the <code>supress_comment</code> option within your <code>.flowconfig</code>. Let’s define two ignore patterns so that we can differentiate between the two types of reasons to ignore listed above:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">suppress_comment=\\\\(.\\\\|\\n\\\\)*\\\\$FlowFixMe</div><div class=\"line\">suppress_comment=\\\\(.\\\\|\\n\\\\)*\\\\$FlowIssue</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now anywhere in our code where we want Flow to ignore a line we can place a<br>comment on the proceeding line:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// $FlowFixMe: We aren't yet ready to refactor this line...</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">manyUntypedArgs</span>(<span class=\"params\">a, b, x, y</span>) </span>&#123; <span class=\"comment\">/* ... */</span> &#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>That’s it!
