Fish shell actually offers code-completion in the terminal as you type. This is a step up from Z shell which would offer decent tab completion but would not print out suggestions for you as you type. What's not great about Z shell is that much like bash customizing it can be a real pain. Fish on the other hand simplifies customization by making everything a function, and making functions easily definable. Here's an example of one I use often with Git:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>function gg -d \\\"Commit all\\\"\\n  git commit -v -a -m \\\"$argv\\\"\\nend</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The first line defines the function <code>gg</code>, and then is passed the optional description option <code>-d</code>. This isn't really important, but it provides a nice and easy way to add a bit of text to remind yourself what the hell these two letters do. When you type <code>gg</code> into the command line and hit tab this description will pop up next to it. Anyway, the second line is easy, it's just a git command with a few options passed. The only part that has to do with Fish shell is the <code>$argv</code> variable which is a â€˜list' of arguments that you pass. In this case I wrap it in <code>\\\"</code> (double quotes) so that I don't have to do that myself. The third line just ends the block. Now I can type something like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>git add .\\ngg Initial Commit</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>And my commit is done without having to type the usual annoying <code>\\\"</code> or <code>-m</code>.</p>\\n<p>What's also great though, is that Fish shell comes with a predefined function called <code>alias</code> that supports the exact same syntax you used in Bash or Z shell. So for all those aliases sitting in your old config file you can just copy them over and be done. Or if you don't have any incompatible code in your alias file (i.e. bash or zsh functions) that would cause things to break, then just source it using the <code>.</code> syntax. Sidenote: Fish doesn't seem to support the familiar <code>source</code> keyword, you have to use the shorthand <code>.</code>.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"caveats\\\"><a href=\\\"#caveats\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Caveats</h2>\\n<p>Two things I've noticed so far that I'm not super thrilled about:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Often have to type <code>cd</code> to change directory</li>\\n<li>No official support for Vim-like editing on the command line</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>That first one is probably customizable somehow but I just didn't put time into figuring out how.
