**The mind doesn't enjoy forced idleness<sup>1</sup>.** This is not a revelation, but I was struck today by the impact this fact can have on productivity.

Idleness was forced upon my mind today when I was forced to reinstall all my project's dependencies. This can take minutes sometimes, so after running `npm install` I was left with an idle moment. The time it takes to install is not long enough to much meaningful work, but it's long enough that you don't just want to sit there waiting. I decided to use the time to check up on some of my favorite git repositories to see if they had new versions out. Some did! Hooray üëè. I installed them, read up on what had changed, went down a few rabbit holes exploring new issues related to the updates and then got back to the initial task at hand‚Äîthe reason I had run `npm install` in the first place...

But I had no idea where I had left off. Now I'm saddled with the task of regaining the context I already had before I ran `npm install`. All part of the job of course, but this could have been avoided if idleness hadn't been forced upon my mind.

\[1\]: I'm all for allowing one's mind to be idle. Mediation or any form of letting one's mind be silent can be hugely beneficial. However, in this case I'm referring to the sort if idleness that arises from _waiting_. When you are working towards some outcome but your progress is forcefully impeded for some amount of time and you're left to your own devices to fill the void in activity.
