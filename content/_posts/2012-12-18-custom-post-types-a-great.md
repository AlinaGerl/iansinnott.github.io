#### Justin Tadlock is a boss

I just read an article (link below) of his on custom post types in WordPress that was illuminating. Also, it turns out he is another developer that jumped ship for Asia (he's in Seoul).

So where was I. Ah, custom posts. Custom posts provide great flexibility for WP developers and a simple user experience for the client. This article is the primary reason I decided to use this feature for my latest client project. I'll be using custom posts to handle addresses for company that has about 20 branches spread over three cities. Nothing too exciting but this will allow simple edits and updates as the company expands. That's all for now, must sleep...

Oh and here's [the link][lnk]Â for anyone interested. Enjoy.
