title: New Site in the Works
---

One of my personal projects recently has been completely redesigning my website. Well, I'm excited to say it's coming along quite nicely. Here is a preview of the new look:

If you have any feedback I'd love to hear it. Feel free to comment bellow.

## Motivation

My motivation for redesigning the site pretty simple: The site hasn't changed in over _two years_. Under "Work", the old site lists a number of personal projects that donâ€™t even exist anymore. The "Skills" section is likewise outdated, listing PHP, MySQL and Photoshop. These days those have all been replaced by Node.js/Ruby, MongoDB and Sketch respectively.

If I'm being honest with myself I don't think the old site is _that_ bad, but it's time for a change. I'll be launching sometime before Christmas. ðŸ˜Ž
